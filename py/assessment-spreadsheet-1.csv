assessment-overview,"<p><em>Note:</em> The assessment included here and under discussion below comes from my &ldquo;British Literature II&rdquo; syllabus, which is also published by <em>Undisciplining the Victorian Classroom</em> in the &ldquo;Beyond Victorian Literature&rdquo; syllabus cluster.</p>
<p>I developed an assessment titled &ldquo;The British Literary Profile Project&rdquo; (BLPP) for my intermediate survey course, &ldquo;British Literature II.&rdquo; I teach this course at Prairie View A&amp;M University, a public Historically Black University. The class-size for the course was capped at twenty-five students, enabling me to teach the course in the style of a seminar. A majority of my students were first-generation university students, with a mixture of majors in English and other fields. For this assessment and the course as a whole, I required no prior knowledge of British literature/history and offered relevant contextual/historical information through the course content.</p>
<p>My institution <a aria-label=""External Link"" href=""https://www.pvamu.edu/blog/pvamu-achieves-prestigious-carnegie-r2-classification/"">recently attained</a> the R2 Carnegie Classification, one of only ten Historically Black Colleges and Universities to have earned this status (<em>pvamu.edu/blog</em>). In keeping with the scholarly expectations of this designation, my pedagogy is focused on practices that elevate BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color) and other vulnerably-positioned students through professionalization, mentorship, and knowledge transfer/creation opportunities in the classroom. With the BLPP assessment, I sought to remove or otherwise address the structural impediments in the way of scholarly research that vulnerable students routinely confront (see, for example, Pascarella et al, Walkington).</p>
<p>I introduced students to BLPP during the fourth week of the semester, after they had read short texts by myriad canonical and lesser-known British and Anglophone authors such as Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Charles Dickens, Toru Dutt, and Olive Schriener. This approach familiarized my students with the wide range of &ldquo;British literary profiles&rdquo; whose voices collectively constitute the landscape of British literature being surveyed in our course. Students completed their essays during the eighth week of the semester, making BLPP the mid-term assessment for the course.</p>
<p>For BLPP, I asked my students to research and discover global Anglophone authors who are either not part of the Victorian canon or, despite being well-known, can be studied with a renewed thematic/cultural focus. In this way, the assessment enabled students to select their preferred method of contributing to our classroom either by rediscovering or by reexamining an author of their choice. BLPP was also part of the representative rather than accommodative pedagogical philosophy that informed &ldquo;British Literature II&rdquo; syllabus as a whole, which includes excerpts rather than complete texts, and thus allows the cognitive space and time necessary for equitable study of British and Anglophone global authors beyond the established literary canon. In other words, works by diverse authors are equally represented in my syllabus instead of accommodated in small amounts around canonical authors and their longer works.</p>
<p>The twenty-first century has seen myriad efforts in recovering forgotten achievers in fields such as literature, art, science, entrepreneurship, and activism. These efforts include restoring the achievers to their rightful place in public memory and decolonial academic curricula along with running obituary series such as <a aria-label=""External Link"" href=""https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/overlooked""><em>Overlooked</em></a> in the <em>New York Times</em>, digital humanities recovery projects such as <a aria-label=""External Link"" href=""https://onemorevoice.org/""><em>One More Voice</em></a>, and events such as the recent <a aria-label=""External Link"" href=""https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/ppr/events/beating-untold-stories""><em>Bearing Untold Stories</em></a> hybrid interdisciplinary symposium. Just as <em>One More Voice</em>&rsquo;s <a aria-label=""External Link"" href=""https://onemorevoice.org/mission_statement.html"">mission statement</a> notes that &ldquo;there is always <em>one more voice</em> to recover from the archives&rdquo; (emphasis original), I contend that there is always one more author to learn about in a literature course, and students can be part of the process..</p>
<p>For example, in &ldquo;Forgotten No More,&rdquo; an assessment I developed for an introductory humanities course focused on nineteenth-century women&rsquo;s rights, I asked students to discover and write about obscure global women achievers. My BLPP assessment similarly enabled students to transgress the canonical boundaries of British literature with their discoveries. Students accomplished this by deploying a combination of three skills. First, students searched online for specific information based on their broad interests, which is a skill at which most were adept. Second, they learned to hone the skill of filtering online search results by identifying credible sources. Third, they acquired the skill of critical evaluation and selection by reviewing topics and choosing a specific subject (in the case of BLPP, a British/Anglophone author) on which to write.</p>
<p>As a result, the assessment was not only representative of the diversity of the British literary field, but also of the academic interests of the student population in my classroom. For example, one student with interest in resurrecting forgotten women achievers utilized BLPP to write about nineteenth-century Australian novelist Matilda Jane Evans, who has become obscure despite her prolific literary output. Another student employed interest in the complex history of abolitionism to write about eighteenth-century Nigerian abolitionist Olaudah Equiano. Another student used the assessment to explore interest in contemporary poetry and oral poetic performance by writing about contemporary British poet Malika Booker.</p>
<p>I graded my students&rsquo; BLPP essays irrespective of which one of these two avenues they chose. A student who decided to rediscover an obscure author wrote a successful essay if they satisfactorily justified their choice and critically analyzed the impact of the author&rsquo;s life and work. Similarly, a student who elected to reexamine a well-known author wrote a successful essay if they satisfactorily justified their reexamination and critically analyzed an overlooked aspect of the author&rsquo;s life and work.</p>
<p>My students&rsquo; responses to the intellectual liberty BLPP afforded them was overwhelmingly positive for two primary reasons. First, several students expressed relief that at a time in the semester rife with mid-term assignments, BLPP did not cause them additional stress and anxiety. They had already been working on their essays for several weeks instead of having to prepare for a timed examination. Second, students appreciated the import of their own intervention. Based on responses I received, including a student who professed a newfound appreciation for British literature, students valued the agency to select an author.</p>
<p>Moreover, while BLPP encouraged the discovery of British literary profiles beyond the literary canon, students also had the option to contemplate popular authors in a new light, an opportunity that enabled them to grasp and exercise the multifaceted power of scholarly research. The assessment effectively conveyed to my students that, based on their individual academic interests, they had the capacity and liberty either to venture into uncharted territory and revive obscure knowledge or to dig deeper into a widely-explored landscape to reveal overlooked knowledge.</p>
<p>I contend that this approach equitably presents the scholarly activity of research to undergraduate student-scholars, loosening the rigid expectations of race and/or area focused research, especially from scholars of color. While facilitating undergraduate research in a minority-serving American institution, I would find it counterintuitive to demand that my minority students focus solely on resurrecting minority authors, while simultaneously advocating for resisting the same racial boundaries that define canonicity in British literature. Thus, for BLPP, one of my students, with a keen interest in the history of British speculative fiction, reexamined J. R. R. Tolkien and the enduring influence of his works. Another student explored their interest in British children&rsquo;s literature by writing about the early life of Anna Laetitia Barbauld. These contributions, along with those by students who resurrected obscure authors, upheld the representative philosophy of our classroom.</p>
<p>My approach, in turn, speaks to a critical debate on area studies that has been ongoing since at least the late twentieth century. For example, Vicente L. Rafael argued in 1994 that &ldquo;area studies not only reiterate different versions of Orientalism; they also produce by necessity multiple repudiations of these versions&rdquo; and &ldquo;to speak of &lsquo;indigenous scholars,&rsquo; for whatever strategic reasons, in the late-twentieth-century United States simultaneously raises the question of the immigrant imaginary in the configuration of area studies&rdquo; (91, 103). In contrast, in an article about area studies and scholarship in Africa, Premesh Lalu recently stated that &ldquo;in the United States, [&hellip;] scholars today transgress disciplinary boundaries readily and freely, experiment endlessly, and shift directions effortlessly, while their African counterparts are pressured by demands for more case studies&rdquo; (129).</p>
<p>Substantiating Lalu&rsquo;s statement, US-based scholars recently called for the transgression of disciplinary boundaries: &ldquo;[I]t might be time to collaborate with disciplinary formations such as area studies, which are marked by their cross-disciplinary and primarily non-European focus. To bridge the gap between nineteenth-century studies and area studies&mdash;to twin, in other words, the temporal axis with a spatial one &ndash; is one way to &lsquo;lateralize&rsquo; Victorian Britain, to think of widening in coeval terms&rdquo; (Banerjee, Fong, and Michie 6-7). Recalling Rafael and Lalu&rsquo;s critique about the racial/ethnic/national stereotyping of scholars of area studies while heeding the call to transcend disciplinary boundaries in the US, I argue that teacher-scholars of British literature must carefully consider whom they expect to answer this call. In practice, I employ this care with assessments such as BLPP in order to inform BIPOC students of the wide range of British literature without bestowing on them the burden of dismantling the canon in one specific way.</p>
<p>In the future, where pandemic-related challenges and inequities hopefully subside, I envision transforming BLPP into an interactive presentation project, thus widening the dissemination of students&rsquo; rediscoveries and reexaminations in the classroom. I also recognize the potential multimodality of the assessment, with blogs and student-led digital humanities projects that can enhance BLPP. Students are much more conversant in digital technologies in the twenty-first century compared to earlier decades. A digital approach would give them the opportunity to capitalize on that and is in the spirit of the assessment in terms of prioritizing student initiative. Notably, BLPP demystified the process of research and showed my students that rigorous scholarship truly begins in the undergraduate classroom and that they can lead such research. BLPP enabled my students to realize that with the power to seek and disseminate the knowledge they deem interesting, they can boldly participate in interventionist research in an eclectic academic field.</p>"
