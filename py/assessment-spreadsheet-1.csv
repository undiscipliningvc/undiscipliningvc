assessment-overview,"<p>“(Post-)Colonial Biography” was created for my undergraduate course
“Women’s Writing and the Global Nineteenth-Century,” which I am teaching
for the first time in Fall 2022. This advanced course, which enrolls a
mixture of English majors and interested non-majors, asks how
nineteenth-century women writers answered the question: “What does
it mean to be free?” Students read memoirs, fiction, essays, and
speeches by women writers across the British Empire. Lectures,
discussions, and assignments invite students to use textual analysis to
examine how these writers imagined, agitated for, and enacted
liberation. I designed “(Post-)Colonial Biography” for this
course, as well as for use in other courses I teach on the literature
and visual culture of British Empire, because I want students to think
about the experience of colonialism as something that they share with
the women writers on the syllabus. Writers like Pandita Ramabai, Rokeya
Sakhawat Hossain, Mary Prince, and Susanna Moody are aware of themselves
as actors within a colonial scene and the way that the horizons of
opportunity and experience for their lives are conditioned by empire.
What would it look like for my students – descended from colonizers and
from colonized people; participants in settler colonialism who are
learning on indigenous land – to develop a similar awareness?</p>

<p>The course is designed to teaching students to closely analyze themes
of liberation in the works we study within the context of the history of
empire. This requires them to adopt methods of intersectional critique,
observing how the power asymmetries created by empire and its legacy of
white supremacy, slavery, and colonialism shapes the different ways that
British, Caribbean, South Asian, U.S., and Canadian settler-colonial
women demand and envision freedom for themselves and for their
communities. To this effect, the course is divided into three
units. Unit 1, “Freedom from Patriarchy,” explores how women writers
advocated for female emancipation and education in patriarchal
societies. We focus on the writings of three feminist women, Mary
Wollstonecraft (Britain), Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain (India), and Pandita
Ramabai (India), but we also read short stories by Olive Schreiner and
Charlotte Perkins Gilman that address themes of women’s oppression and
liberation. Unit 2, “Freedom from Slavery,” focuses on two memoirs by
formerly enslaved women, <em>The History of Mary Prince</em> and Harriet
Jacobs’ <em>Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl</em>, to consider how
these writers portray the intersection oppressions of colonialism,
chattel slavery and patriarchy. To cap off this section, we read the
opening chapters of <em>Jane Eyre</em>, asking how this narrative of
white female emancipation appropriates the literary conventions of the
slave narrative. Unit 3, “Freedom to Move,” addresses excerpts from
Susanna Moody’s <em>Roughing it in the Bush</em>, a settler-colonial
pioneer narrative considered a feminist classic in Canada, and asks how
white female self-determination in the settler colony not only enacts,
but constitutes itself through, violence against indigenous
communities.</p>

<p>“(Post-)Colonial Biography” attempts to move students from a
historically and culturally specific analysis of nineteenth-century
empire to a presentist analysis of the effects of empire on their own
lives today. I do this by asking them to write a biography of a someone
or something they care about that is connected to European or U.S.
empires. Four prompts are available, each directing students to a
different form of biography. In option 1, they can interview someone
they love, such as an elder family member or a friend, who experienced
British colonialism, or neo- or post-coloniality. Option 2 invites them
to write an autobiography, investigating how their own lives are shaped
by British or U.S. imperialism. Option 3 asks students to consider how
they participate in U.S. settler colonialism by researching Ho-Chunk
history on or around UW-Madison’s campus. Option 4 allows students to
write a biography of a favorite musical artist who comes from a former
British colony or commonwealth country, like Rihanna or Nicki Minaj; or
of a colonial commodity, like tea or chocolate. The awkward punctuation
of my title – (post-)colonial – attempts to register the multiple relations
to empire that students might discover. These prompts are available to
all students, including white U.S.-born students, but I hope that they
will empower students of color and students from immigrant families to
examine their own family experiences of post/coloniality.</p>

<p>I have explained how this assignment situates itself in my syllabus
for “Women Writers and the Global Nineteenth Century,” but I want to
address the role that it can play in Victorian Studies curricula more
broadly. “(Post-)Colonial Biography” invites students to discover
through research, reflect upon, and explain to others how the effects of
empire are felt in the present. The assignment is a response to an issue
that I come up against regularly when I teach on empire, colonialism,
and the history of slavery: the tendency of my students to distance
themselves from the course material by reflecting on how such crimes
against humanity happened “back then,” before “we” learned that such
things were wrong. This gesture reflects, in part, the understandable
but erroneous assumption that history belongs to the past. For example,
after reading Shashi Tharoor’s vivid description of Britain’s
colonization of India in <em>Inglorious Empire</em>, one student
exclaimed in genuine anger and confusion, “How could this have been
allowed to happen?” I was grateful for my student’s moral outrage. But
we were having this conversation on the ancestral land of the Ho-Chunk
people in September 2021, shortly after President Biden pulled U.S.
troops out of Afghanistan after a 20-year occupation. I had opened my
students’ eyes to the western history of colonialism, but they were not
yet able to think of colonialism as a <em>living history</em>, one that
is ongoing.</p>

<p>In this regard, the assignment is meant for any course in Victorian
Studies that addresses empire or colonialism. I have designed it with my
particular students and institution in mind, in the Department of
English at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, but with adjustments it
can translate across national and institutional contexts. UW-Madison is
a predominantly white institution (PWI). The majority of enrolled
students identify as white and are Wisconsin natives, and most are
women. However, the course also enrolls students from across the
country, including international and exchange students, and includes a
contingent of students of color, primarily of Asian descent. Likely
because of the title and description, more women of color and immigrant
students have enrolled in this course than in a typical
nineteenth-century literature course that I teach: this semester I have
students born in Pakistan, Bangladesh, and China. Instructors in the UK
whose courses enroll primarily white students may like to invite their
students to research the colonial origins of a campus building they
frequent or a cultural institution build from the profits of chattel
slavery. Instructors at Historically Black Colleges and Universities
(HBCUs) or minority-serving institutions (MSIs) can similarly design
prompts that invite students to research how colonial history shaped
family histories of enslavement, displacement, migration, community
building, language learning, and resistance.</p>

<p>Built into the assignment is my community-based research and writing
pedagogy, which asks students to create work that teaches one another
something they have learned. The assignment is also designed with
contract grading in mind. Because other instructors may not share these
practices, let me say a few words about how they work and why I have
chosen them. I have written in the past about my <a aria-label=""External Link""
href=""http://ncgsjournal.com/issue171/shubert.html"">selective use of
contract grading</a> to promote equity and engaged learning in a
year of remote learning during the covid-19 pandemic. Based on the
success of this experiment, I now exclusively use labor-based contract
grading. All assignments are graded complete/incomplete, with students
receiving final grades based on the amount of work they have completed
over the course of the semester. I find that my students thrive when
labor-based grading is paired with a horizontal knowledge-sharing ethos.
For example, “(Post-)Colonial Biography” asks groups of four students to
read or watch each other’s work, complete a peer review worksheet that
asks them to reflect on what they learned from each project and to
analyze the quality of research and analysis in each, and then meet up
outside of class for an informal conversation in which they share
insights and feedback. Finally, they will submit to me a brief
reflection on what they learned from the process as a whole. This kind
of scaffolding means that students’ social and educational
responsibility to one another and to the collective project of learning
is contingent upon the work of researching, writing, reading, and
thinking critically. While contract grading and community-based pedagogy
may not be possible in all contexts, I urge instructors to thoughtfully
consider how to respond to and assess its learning objectives without
passing judgment on students’ personal reflections or experiences.</p>"
