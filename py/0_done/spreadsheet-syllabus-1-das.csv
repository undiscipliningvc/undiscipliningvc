cluster-description,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Not all faculty members with backgrounds in Victorian Studies have the opportunity to teach courses focused solely on either Victorian or nineteenth-century literature and writers. These syllabi offer models for pairing canonical Victorian texts with lesser-known, noncanonical, transnational, and contemporary texts or adaptations to extend conversations in courses that move beyond &ldquo;Victorian&rdquo; literature. By putting together traditional Victorian texts with Romantic, Modern, and Contemporary ones, these syllabi complicate the term &ldquo;Victorian&rdquo; as a designator of nationality, region, time period, and race. What is implied or excluded when talking about &ldquo;Victorian&rdquo; or &ldquo;neo-Victorian&rdquo; literature? The syllabi in this cluster offer illustrations of how antiracist and anticolonial methodologies can form the foundation of undergraduate classes not designated as either Victorian or nineteenth-century literature in college/university course catalogs&mdash;specifically, intermediate &ldquo;British Literature II&rdquo; and advanced &ldquo;Multiethnic Literature&rdquo; courses. Finally, they demonstrate how student-led research projects that ask students to delve into texts and writers beyond the British isles invite students into conversations about what literature gets taught and how course titles structure&mdash;and often limit&mdash;those decisions.</span></p>"
