zoomcast-overview,"<p>Sophia Hsu interviews five nineteenth-century scholars (Menglu Gao, Waiyee Loh, Hyungji Park, Jessica Valdez, and Rae X. Yan) to discuss the development of a lesson plan cluster called “Transimperial Networks and East Asia.” This cluster explores the centrality of East Asia to Victorian Studies. A crucial impetus for this cluster, facilitator Sophia Hsu suggests, included finding an effective way to respond to the increase in anti-Asian violence and discrimination during COVID-19. The result became a dual partnership between breaking bread within a female pedagogical community while innovating class lessons that re-“orient” students’ relationship to the global nineteenth century.</p>"

zoomcast-series-description,"<p>This cluster of Zoomcasts reflects upon team-based scholarship as a strategy of undisciplining and empowerment in both learning and teaching. Although collaboration often lies at the heart of digital humanities projects like <em>Undisciplining the Victorian Classroom</em>, the single-scholar mode of endeavor and production often remains the default for many Victorianists. The Zoomcasts in this cluster, therefore, highlight successful collaborations within Victorian Studies and beyond in order to uncover strategies and models that Victorianists and other scholars might employ to broaden the scope and impact of their work. By doing so, scholars have the potential to develop new and exciting modes of inquiry, while breaking with traditional Eurocentric ways of engaging with Victorian and other kinds of British and Anglophone literature.</p>"
