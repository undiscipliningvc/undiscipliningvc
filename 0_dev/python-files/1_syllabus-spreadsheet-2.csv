cluster-description,"While religion remains a central topic in the field of Victorian Studies, scholars continue to prioritize Christian perspectives. This cluster of syllabi provides resources that expand engagement beyond Christianity, highlighting texts by and about those considered religious “others” in the nineteenth century. Through frameworks from Postcolonial and Religious Studies, the cluster decenters white Christian metropolitan Britishness by amplifying the voices of those who have been often overlooked due to racial and religious biases. At their best, religions cultivate attitudes of care, and in teasing out the multifaceted Victorian religious perspectives with which students may not be familiar, these syllabi seek to broaden religious tolerance, awareness, and appreciation."
biography,"Alyssa Quinn Johnson is a Ph.D. candidate in English literature at Texas Christian University, where she is preparing to defend her dissertation on Gothicized depictions of Protestant fanatics in nineteenth-century British fiction. Her research interests lie at the intersection of religion and the Gothic in long-nineteenth-century British fiction."
