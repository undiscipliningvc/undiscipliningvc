Sure, here's how you can do that:

1. Modify the CSV file to have two columns and call it "stranded".
2. Open the CSV file and find the data in the second column, second row. Let's say the value is "123".
3. Open the HTML file called "tron" and find the text "xxx" in the file. Replace it with "123".
4. Next, find the data in the third row, second column of the CSV file. Let's say the value is "456".
5. Open the HTML file again and find the text "yyy". Replace it with "456".

Here's an example Python code that can do this for you:

```python
import csv

# Open the CSV file and find the data
with open('stranded.csv', 'r') as csvfile:
    reader = csv.reader(csvfile)
    data = list(reader)
    second_row_second_col = data[1][1]
    third_row_second_col = data[2][1]

# Open the HTML file and replace the text
with open('tron.html', 'r') as f:
    html = f.read()
    html = html.replace('xxx', second_row_second_col)
    html = html.replace('yyy', third_row_second_col)

# Save the modified HTML file
with open('tron.html', 'w') as f:
    f.write(html)
```

Hope this helps!

Yes, you can automate this process for multiple HTML files by wrapping the code I provided earlier in a loop that iterates over a list of HTML files. Here's an example code that shows how to do this:

```python
import csv
import os

# Define the name of the CSV file and its columns
csv_filename = 'stranded.csv'
csv_columns = ['column1', 'column2']

# Define a list of HTML files to update
html_files = ['tron.html', 'neon.html', 'cyber.html']

# Open the CSV file and read the data
with open(csv_filename, 'r') as csvfile:
    reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile, fieldnames=csv_columns)
    data = list(reader)

    # Remove the header row
    data.pop(0)

    # Loop over the HTML files and update them
    for html_filename in html_files:
        # Read the contents of the HTML file
        with open(html_filename, 'r') as f:
            html = f.read()

        # Replace the placeholders in the HTML file with the data from the CSV file
        for row in data:
            html = html.replace(f'{{{row["column1"]}}}', row["column2"])

        # Save the updated HTML file
        with open(os.path.splitext(html_filename)[0] + '_updated.html', 'w') as f:
            f.write(html)
```

In this code, the `csv_filename` variable contains the name of the CSV file, and `csv_columns` contains the names of its columns. The `html_files` list contains the names of the HTML files to be updated.

The code then opens the CSV file and reads its data using the `csv.DictReader` class. It removes the header row, and then loops over the HTML files using a `for` loop.

Inside the loop, the code reads the contents of the HTML file, replaces the placeholders in the file with the data from the CSV file using a nested `for` loop, and then saves the updated HTML file with a `_updated` suffix added to its filename.

Note that this code assumes that the placeholders in the HTML file are enclosed in curly braces and match the values in the `column1` column of the CSV file. For example, if the placeholder in the HTML file is `{xyz}`, then the value in the `column1` column of the CSV file should be `xyz`.

To run the script, follow these steps:

1. Open a text editor such as Notepad or Sublime Text.
2. Copy and paste the code I provided earlier into the text editor.
3. Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `update_html.py`.
4. Open a command prompt or terminal window.
5. Navigate to the directory where you saved the `update_html.py` file.
6. Run the script by typing `python update_html.py` and pressing Enter.

The script will then read the data from the `stranded.csv` file and update the HTML files specified in the `html_files` list. The updated HTML files will be saved in the same directory with a `_updated` suffix added to their filenames.

Make sure that you have Python installed on your computer before running the script. You can check if you have Python installed by typing `python --version` in the command prompt or terminal window. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Sure, here's the modified code that reads from the three CSV files (`red.csv`, `white.csv`, and `blue.csv`) and updates the corresponding three HTML files (`green.html`, `yellow.html`, and `orange.html`):

```python
import csv
import os

# Define the names of the CSV files and their columns
csv_filenames = {
    'red': 'red.csv',
    'white': 'white.csv',
    'blue': 'blue.csv',
}
csv_columns = ['column1', 'column2']

# Define the names of the HTML files to update
html_filenames = {
    'green': 'green.html',
    'yellow': 'yellow.html',
    'orange': 'orange.html',
}

# Loop over the CSV files and update their corresponding HTML files
for color, csv_filename in csv_filenames.items():
    # Open the CSV file and read the data
    with open(csv_filename, 'r') as csvfile:
        reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile, fieldnames=csv_columns, delimiter='\t')
        data = list(reader)

        # Remove the header row
        data.pop(0)

        # Read the contents of the corresponding HTML file
        html_filename = html_filenames[color]
        with open(html_filename, 'r') as f:
            html = f.read()

        # Replace the placeholders in the HTML file with the data from the CSV file
        for row in data:
            html = html.replace(f'{{{row["column1"]}}}', row["column2"])

        # Save the updated HTML file
        updated_html_filename = os.path.splitext(html_filename)[0] + '_updated.html'
        with open(updated_html_filename, 'w') as f:
            f.write(html)
```

In this code, the `csv_filenames` dictionary maps each color to its CSV filename, and the `html_filenames` dictionary maps each color to its HTML filename.

The code then loops over the `csv_filenames` dictionary using the `items()` method, and for each color, it opens the corresponding CSV file and reads its data, removes the header row, and reads the contents of the corresponding HTML file.

It then replaces the placeholders in the HTML file with the data from the CSV file using a nested `for` loop, and saves the updated HTML file with a `_updated` suffix added to its filename.

Note that this code assumes that the placeholders in the HTML files are enclosed in curly braces and match the values in the `column1` column of the CSV files. For example, if the placeholder in the HTML file is `{xyz}`, then the value in the `column1` column of the CSV file should be `xyz`.
