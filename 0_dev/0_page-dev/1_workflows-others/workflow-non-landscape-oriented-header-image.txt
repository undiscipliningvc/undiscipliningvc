# Preparing a Non-Landscape-Orientation Header Image

## Overview

- Occasionally an author may prefer to use a single image that is square or vertically-oriented as the header image of a page. This image needs to be prepared by a special process so that it looks appropriate on the UVC website given our site formatting and set up. 
- The step in the next subsection will place the image on a wider horizontal and vertical field and enable it to be added to the UVC site. 
- Existing examples of such images can be found on the following two lesson plans:
1. contemporary_postcolonial_texts.html
2. contemporary_undisciplining_introduction.html 

## Steps to Prepare Image

- Note: For steps #2 and #3 below, you can also use the workflow-non-landscape-orientated-header-image.xlsx file, which will automatically calculate the new width and height once you enter the current dimesions of the image.

1. Identify the image size in pixels. In Mac, this can be done by selecting the image, then pressing cmd + I
2. Get 1/10 of the image height; mutiply it by 2; add that amount to height. The new number will be the height of the Photoshop canvas.
3. Take that new height and multiply it by 16/9 (1.77778). The new number will be the width of the Photoshop canvas.
4. Open the image in Photoshop. 
5. Select Image > Canvas Size. 
6. Switch the quantity to pixels. 
7. Enter the (pixel) width and height numbers derived in the prior steps. 
8. Select black or gray for background (see what looks better). 
9. Click OK, then Save. The image is ready to be integrated into the site.
