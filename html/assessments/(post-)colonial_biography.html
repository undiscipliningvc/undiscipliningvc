					<p>“(Post-)Colonial Biography” was created for my undergraduate course
					“Women’s Writing and the Global Nineteenth-Century,” which I am teaching
					for the first time in Fall 2022. This advanced course, which enrolls a
					mixture of English majors and interested non-majors, asks how
					nineteenth-century women writers answered the question: “What does
					it mean to be free?” Students read memoirs, fiction, essays, and
					speeches by women writers across the British Empire. Lectures,
					discussions, and assignments invite students to use textual analysis to
					examine how these writers imagined, agitated for, and enacted
					liberation.</p>

					<p>I designed “(Post-)Colonial Biography” for this course, as well as
					for use in other courses I teach on the literature and visual culture of
					British Empire, because I want students to think about the experience of
					colonialism as something that they share with the women writers on the
					syllabus. Writers like Pandita Ramabai, Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain, Mary
					Prince, and Susanna Moody are aware of themselves as actors within a
					colonial scene and the way that the horizons of opportunity and
					experience for their lives are conditioned by empire. What would it look
					like for my students – descended from colonizers and from colonized
					people; participants in settler colonialism who are learning on
					indigenous land – to develop a similar awareness?</p>

					<p>The course is designed to teaching students to closely analyze themes
					of liberation in the works we study within the context of the history of
					empire. This requires them to adopt methods of intersectional critique,
					observing how the power asymmetries created by empire and its legacy of
					white supremacy, slavery, and colonialism shapes the different ways that
					British, Caribbean, South Asian, U.S., and Canadian settler-colonial
					women demand and envision freedom for themselves and for their
					communities. To this effect, the course is divided into three
					units.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Unit 1, “Freedom from Patriarchy,” explores how women writers
						advocated for female emancipation and education in patriarchal
						societies. We focus on the writings of three feminist women, Mary
						Wollstonecraft (Britain), Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain (India), and Pandita
						Ramabai (India), but we also read short stories by Olive Schreiner and
						Charlotte Perkins Gilman that address themes of women’s oppression and
						liberation.</li>

						<li>Unit 2, “Freedom from Slavery,” focuses on two memoirs by
						formerly enslaved women, <em>The History of Mary Prince</em> and Harriet
						Jacobs’ <em>Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl</em>, to consider how
						these writers portray the intersection oppressions of colonialism,
						chattel slavery and patriarchy. To cap off this section, we read the
						opening chapters of <em>Jane Eyre</em>, asking how this narrative of
						white female emancipation appropriates the literary conventions of the
						slave narrative.</li>

						<li>Unit 3, “Freedom to Move,” addresses excerpts from Susanna
						Moody’s <em>Roughing it in the Bush</em>, a settler-colonial pioneer
						narrative considered a feminist classic in Canada, and asks how white
						female self-determination in the settler colony not only enacts, but
						constitutes itself through, violence against indigenous
						communities.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>“(Post-)Colonial Biography” attempts to move students from a
					historically and culturally specific analysis of nineteenth-century
					empire to a presentist analysis of the effects of empire on their own
					lives today. I do this by asking them to write a biography of someone or
					something they care about that is connected to European or U.S. empires.
					Four prompts are available, each directing students to a different form
					of biography:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Option 1: Students interview someone they love, such as an elder
						family member or a friend, who experienced British colonialism, or neo-
						or post-coloniality.</li>

						<li>Option 2: Students write an autobiography, investigating how their
						own lives are shaped by British or U.S. imperialism.</li>

						<li>Option 3: Students consider how they participate in U.S. settler
						colonialism by researching Ho-Chunk history on or around UW-Madison’s
						campus.</li>

						<li>Option 4: Students to write a biography of a favorite musical artist
						who comes from a former British colony or commonwealth country, like
						Rihanna or Nicki Minaj; or of a colonial commodity, like tea or
						chocolate.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>The awkward punctuation of my title – (post-)colonial – attempts to
					register the multiple relations to empire that students might discover.
					These prompts are available to all students, including white U.S.-born
					students, but I hope that they will empower students of color and
					students from immigrant families to examine their own family experiences
					of post/coloniality.</p>

					<p>I have explained how this assignment situates itself in my syllabus
					for “Women Writers and the Global Nineteenth Century,” but I want to
					address the role that it can play in Victorian Studies curricula more
					broadly. “(Post-)Colonial Biography” invites students to discover
					through research, reflect upon, and explain to others how the effects of
					empire are felt in the present. The assignment is a response to an issue
					that I come up against regularly when I teach on empire, colonialism,
					and the history of slavery: the tendency of my students to distance
					themselves from the course material by reflecting on how such crimes
					against humanity happened “back then,” before “we” learned that such
					things were wrong.</p>

					<p>This gesture reflects, in part, the understandable but erroneous
					assumption that history belongs to the past. For example, after reading
					Shashi Tharoor’s vivid description of Britain’s colonization of India in
					<em>Inglorious Empire</em>, one student exclaimed in genuine anger and
					confusion, “How could this have been allowed to happen?” I was grateful
					for my student’s moral outrage. But we were having this conversation on
					the ancestral land of the Ho-Chunk people in September 2021, shortly
					after President Biden pulled U.S. troops out of Afghanistan after a
					20-year occupation. I had opened my students’ eyes to the western
					history of colonialism, but they were not yet able to think of
					colonialism as a <em>living history</em>, one that is ongoing.</p>

					<p>In this regard, the assignment is meant for any course in Victorian
					Studies that addresses empire or colonialism. I have designed it with my
					particular students and institution in mind, in the Department of
					English at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, but with adjustments it
					can translate across national and institutional contexts. UW-Madison is
					a predominantly white institution (PWI). The majority of enrolled
					students identify as white and are Wisconsin natives, and most are
					women. However, the course also enrolls students from across the
					country, including international and exchange students, and includes a
					contingent of students of color, primarily of Asian descent. Likely
					because of the title and description, more women of color and immigrant
					students have enrolled in this course than in a typical
					nineteenth-century literature course that I teach: this semester I have
					students born in Pakistan, Bangladesh, and China.</p>

					<p>Instructors in the UK whose courses enroll primarily white students
					may like to invite their students to research the colonial origins of a
					campus building they frequent or a cultural institution build from the
					profits of chattel slavery. Instructors at Historically Black Colleges
					and Universities (HBCUs) or minority-serving institutions (MSIs) can
					similarly design prompts that invite students to research how colonial
					history shaped family histories of enslavement, displacement, migration,
					community building, language learning, and resistance.</p>

					<p>Built into the assignment is my community-based research and writing
					pedagogy, which asks students to create work that teaches one another
					something they have learned. The assignment is also designed with
					contract grading in mind. Because other instructors may not share these
					practices, let me say a few words about how they work and why I have
					chosen them. I have written in the past about my <a aria-label="External Link"
					href="http://ncgsjournal.com/issue171/shubert.html"><u>selective use of
					contract grading</u></a> to promote equity and engaged learning in a
					year of remote learning during the covid-19 pandemic. Based on the
					success of this experiment, I now exclusively use labor-based contract
					grading. All assignments are graded complete/incomplete, with students
					receiving final grades based on the amount of work they have completed
					over the course of the semester.</p>

					<p>I find that my students thrive when labor-based grading is paired
					with a horizontal knowledge-sharing ethos. For example, “(Post-)Colonial
					Biography” asks groups of four students to read or watch each other’s
					work, complete a peer review worksheet that asks them to reflect on what
					they learned from each project and to analyze the quality of research
					and analysis in each, and then meet up outside of class for an informal
					conversation in which they share insights and feedback. Finally, they
					will submit to me a brief reflection on what they learned from the
					process as a whole. This kind of scaffolding means that students’ social
					and educational responsibility to one another and to the collective
					project of learning is contingent upon the work of researching, writing,
					reading, and thinking critically. While contract grading and
					community-based pedagogy may not be possible in all contexts, I urge
					instructors to thoughtfully consider how to respond to and assess its
					learning objectives without passing judgment on students’ personal
					reflections or experiences.</p>
