				<section aria-labelledby="goals-and-questions">
					<h3 id="goals-and-questions">Goals and Questions</h3>

					<p>In times of political upheaval, societal unrest, or intellectual evolution, authors often direct their gaze toward the future. Dystopia, a term first coined by Thomas More in 1516,<a aria-label="External Link" href="#endnote-1" class="endnote-ref" id="endnote-1-ref">1</a> envisions a corrupted future that frequently mirrors the anxieties and preoccupations of the contemporary era. Dystopian literature serves as a refuge for the exploration of radical ideas and reflections on the current state of existence. Conversely, utopias also arise from concerns about the future but opt to imagine a world that has successfully purged itself of present issues, existing in a liberated and transcendent liminal space. Utopian fiction advocates for change by presenting a vision of a hopeful future and the transformative possibilities that could positively alter society.</p>

					<p>Despite both genres being deeply political and forward-looking in their arguments, their manifestations diverge significantly. This three-week lesson plan (or unit) aims to dissect the similarities and differences between dystopian and utopian fiction, probing why authors may opt for one over the other. Rather than relying on commonly used, Eurocentric literature, this unit employs texts written by authors impacted by racism and colonialism to examine how these factors affect societal outlooks on dystopian and utopian fiction. Specifically, students read a pioneering Afrofuturist text by W.E.B. Dubois entitled “The Comet,” as well as a highly regarded South Asian Victorian utopian text by Rokeya Hossain that critiques British colonialism.</p>

					<p>Within this overarching objective, the lesson plan stages discussions regarding other social inequalities related to gender and class and how they manifest within the utopian and dystopian genres. The exploration of these themes supports a nuanced understanding of the socio-political underpinnings that shape and define these speculative literary forms.</p>

					<p>Within this unit, several critical concerns and questions arise for discussion. A significant one centers around the impact of race on both dystopian and utopian literary genres. Additionally, the lesson plan delves into exploring the distinctions between dystopian and utopian literature, while also considering arguments regarding their classification within the same genre. Throughout the lesson plan, students also examine how real-world circumstances distinctly influence these genres and whether the circumstances primarily serve as reflections on the future or as commentaries on contemporary society.</p>

					<section aria-labelledby="overview">
						<h4 id="overview">Overview</h4>

						<p>This unit is made in mind for high-school-level students. Based on how the readings are scaffolded and discussion questions, this could be appropriate for a 9-12th grade range. (Note: This <a aria-label="External Link" href="http://govdocs.nebraska.gov/epubs/E2000/B109-2013.pdf">guide</a> (PDF) shows how one may approach changing the current standards for this lesson plan into a different grade-level than the current standards set at the 10th grade level.) Currently structured for three weeks, this unit has the flexibility for expansion by incorporating additional activities and delving deeper into the suggested readings. Conversely, the unit can be streamlined into a one-week format if the emphasis shifts toward establishing a general understanding of utopian and dystopian literature. The adaptable nature of this unit allows for customization based on the depth of exploration desired within the given timeframe.</p>

					<section aria-labelledby="week-one">
						<h4 id="week-one">Week One: What is Futurity, Utopia, and Afrofuturism?</h4>

						<p>During the first week, the focus is on elucidating the reasons individuals often turn to the future when engaging in discussions about contemporary politics and social movements, especially those regarding race. To facilitate this exploration, students gain a foundational understanding of “futurity” and its application in recent literature. The article “The Novel Solutions of Utopian Fiction” serves as a key resource, delving into the sociological aspects of utopia. Additionally, a TED talk on the history of utopia offers a more accessible entry point into comprehending the motivations behind the existence of utopian visions.</p>

						<p>The week's discussions also extend to Afrofuturism, providing students with insights into how this perspective may diverge from conventional understandings of utopias. By incorporating Afrofuturism, the goal is to broaden student understanding of futurity, examining it through a lens that considers race as well as diverse cultural and social contexts. Through these explorations, students will not only grasp the theoretical underpinnings of utopian thought but also develop a nuanced appreciation for the diverse ways in which visions of the future intersect with and reflect contemporary concerns.</p>

Further information can be found at the Nebraska ELA Standards <a aria-label="External Link" href="https://www.education.ne.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ELA-Standards-2021-8-25-22.pdf">website</a>.

						<h4 id="week-two">Week Two: What is Dystopian Literature?</h4>

						<p>During the second week, students delve deeper into the nuances of dystopian literature. The fundamental question of why dystopias are imagined and what societal conditions give rise to them are explored. Questions of how racial biases and injustices affect the genre also come up and should be a major point of discussion throughout this week. Through engaging discussions, students examine both the merits and pitfalls of dystopian narratives, encouraging critical thinking about their implications.</p>

						<p>Additionally, the week encourages students to embark on a journey of personal introspection, considering how dystopian themes resonate within their own lives and shape their political perspectives. Questions of their race and positionality may come into discussion as well. This reflective process serves as a bridge between the preceding and subsequent weeks, paving the way for a comprehensive exploration of the contrasts and parallels between utopian and dystopian literature.</p>

						<p>A significant aspect of this week involves fostering a space for personal reflection, where students' insights and contributions are highly valued. This environment encourages open dialogue on topics of personal significance, while also emphasizing the importance of respectful disagreement within a professional academic setting.</p>

						<h4 id="week-three">Week Three: The Difference Between Dystopian and Utopian Literature</h4>

						<p>During the third week, students focus on exploring and analyzing the contrasting genres of dystopian and utopian literature. Through the examination of two fictional short stories, the students delve into the differing tones and intents of the stories and examine how the genre of each story portrays alternative visions of society.</p>

						<p>Additionally, the week encourages students to critically evaluate the effectiveness of both dystopian and utopian literature in instigating real-world change. Students consider whether these genres serve as catalysts for societal transformation or merely speculative exercises.</p>

						<p>Furthermore, this week emphasizes the importance of examining dystopian and utopian literature from diverse perspectives beyond the white gaze. Students explore how these genres resonate with African Americans of the Diaspora in the modern era as well as South Asian cultures from the Victorian era under colonial rule, and discuss the necessity of such literature within these communities. Instructors are advised that these discussions may elicit strong emotions and challenging viewpoints, underscoring the need to foster a safe and supportive environment for open dialogue before staging the dialogue itself.</p>

						<p>In this final week, a summative assessment would be most beneficial. Note: As a scholar examining education as a carceral system, I do not design or assign summative assessments in my own classroom. However, I recognize the constraints and requirements that come with teaching in public school systems and believe an assessment focused on possible definitions and overall characteristics of dystopian and utopian literature would be appropriate to conclude this lesson plan with.</p>
