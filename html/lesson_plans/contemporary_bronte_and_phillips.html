					<h3 id="description">Cluster/Pair Description</h3>
					<p>This cluster pairing invites students to investigate the history of the Black Atlantic through Emily Brontë's <em>Wuthering Heights</em> (1847) and Caryl Phillips&rsquo;s <em>The Lost Child</em> (2015). In small groups, students analyze digital artifacts and sources about Liverpool and the Atlantic slave trade, which prepares them to discuss race, racialization, and white supremacy in <em>Wuthering Heights</em>, and to consider how they influence the novel&rsquo;s love and marriage plots, its Gothic revenge narrative, its representations of property and lineage, its characters&rsquo; anxiety over Heathcliff&rsquo;s uncertain racial, ethnic, and class origins, and its narrative gaps<em>.</em></p>

					<p>Caryl Phillips&rsquo;s contemporary works take up questions of history, race, violence, and erasure, often using experimental narrative techniques to depict characters and experiences of the Black Atlantic. In his nonfiction travel book <em>The Atlantic Sound </em>(2000), Phillips journeys from the Caribbean to Britain in a banana boat, reliving the journey he and his family made from St. Kitts when he was a child and visiting major historical cities of the transatlantic slave trade. His novel <em>The Lost Child </em>takes up the story of Heathcliff and his mother in Liverpool and refracts it against other, interconnected plotlines, including scenes of Emily Brontë on her deathbed in 1848 and the coming-of-age story of Ben, a music lover and a biracial boy growing up in postwar Leeds and London. Excerpts from <em>The Atlantic Sound</em> prepare students to read and discuss the fractured, prismatic storylines of <em>The Lost Child</em>, including the novel&rsquo;s focus on the story of Heathcliff and his mother before his arrival at Wuthering Heights, parallels between Heathcliff&rsquo;s and Ben&rsquo;s stories, and Phillips&rsquo;s variety of narrative techniques. Students also take part in an activity where they analyze the lyrics of different twentieth-century songs that are woven throughout Ben&rsquo;s sections, discussing his experiences of alienation and his ability to find strength and solace in popular music.</p>

					<p>Building on this interaction between the past and the present, this lesson plan prepares students to undertake a final adaptation assignment in which they can either research and analyze how a twentieth or twenty-first century text refracts <em>Wuthering Heights, </em>or create their own adaptation<em>. </em>This lesson plan is part of an upper-level undergraduate course called &ldquo;The Brontë's and After,&rdquo; in which students also consider other intertextual relationships among Victorian and postmodern or contemporary novels (among, for example, Charlotte Brontë&rsquo;s <em>Jane Eyre</em>, Jean Rhys&rsquo;s <em>Wide Sargasso Sea</em>, and Namwali Serpell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Double Men&rdquo;).</p>
					
					<p>This lesson plan is organized into two units, one on <em>Wuthering Heights</em> and one on <em>The Lost Child</em>. The suggested activities, sources, and sample discussion questions are not intended to be comprehensive, but rather to indicate just a few possible starting points for investigating these rich, complex novels with students. Any further suggestions or corrections are very welcome.</p>
				</section>

				<section aria-labelledby="frameworks">
					<h3 id="frameworks">Critical Frameworks</h3>
					<p>I like to start the semester with <em>Wuthering Heights</em> because it is in the public domain and can be accessed quickly and easily by students in the first week of class, leaving more time for them to order <em>The Lost Child </em>through our local or city library, if they choose. However, this order does have its pitfalls, in that it could lead students to see one text as original and the other as derivative. Olivia Loksing Moy cautions against reading modes that reinforce &ldquo;colonial patterns of urtext and sequel, original and copy. To read adaptations as more than just homage is a given, but to read them as more than simply resistance and &lsquo;writing back&rsquo; also requires conscientious interventions&rdquo; (Moy, 2020, p. 410).</p>

					<p>Since I teach <em>Wuthering Heights </em>first, I find it helpful to ward off reductive claims about originality and derivation by anticipating and discussing this dynamic with students, and emphasizing <em>Wuthering Heights&rsquo;s </em>status not as an canonical original urtext but as a book that is itself embedded in other precursor texts and tropes that have been widely discussed by critics (the Gothic tradition, the Byronic hero, the Bible, <em>The Thousand and One Nights</em>, etc.) I also introduce students to some of Phillips&rsquo;s numerous literary interests beyond the story of <em>Wuthering Heights, </em>including his travel writing, his depictions of other authors (such as Jean Rhys in <em>A View of the Empire at Sunset</em>) as well as <em>The Lost Child&rsquo;s </em>investment in postmodern narrative techniques and popular music. Another approach is to reverse the order, teaching the adaptation before the Victorian text (see Poland 2023)<!-- Change -->, or to read and discuss adaptation theories that invite students to interrogate notions of aesthetic originality (see Fox 2023).<!-- Change -->

					<p>To prepare students to read <em>Wuthering Heights </em>together, it&rsquo;s important to discuss how we will collectively navigate some of the problematic and racialized terms that appear in the novel, as well as help students understand terms and images that they may not recognize as racialized because of the unfamiliar historical context. Meyer (1996), Sneidern (1995), and Watson (2001) are all helpful resources for instructors to prepare for this discussion. I also incorporate discussion questions from the syllabus by Bindas (2021).</p>

					<p>Liverpool&rsquo;s significance as a major slave port is essential context for <em>Wuthering Heights</em>. Rather than lecture on Liverpool&rsquo;s history, I invite students to take part in a small group activity in which they analyze visual images of Liverpool and digitized historical artifacts from the <a href="https://understandingslavery.com/">Understanding Slavery Initiative</a>, read a short essay by Lunt (2021) on Liverpool&rsquo;s ties to slavery in <em>The Black Curriculum</em>, and discuss Liverpool&rsquo;s status as a diverse international port city with established communities of Black, Irish, and Chinese residents and travellers from all over the world (National Museums Liverpool, &ldquo;Resources,&rdquo; n.d.). This historical context helps prepare students to discuss the scenes of Earnshaw&rsquo;s trip to Liverpool and Heathcliff&rsquo;s arrival at Wuthering Heights, and to speculate about the gaps in Earnshaw&rsquo;s account.</p>

					<p>On our first day of <em>The Lost Child</em>, I introduce students to Phillips and his works, and we discuss excerpts from <em>The Atlantic Sound</em>, in which Phillips recounts his journey to Liverpool and the city&rsquo;s erasure of its ties to slavery. We also read Agathocleous&rsquo;s (Phillips 2015) interview with Phillips and discuss his interest in the moors and his eventual fascination with the story of Heathcliff&rsquo;s origins. Phillips&rsquo; insistence that the retelling of history must be non-linear helps prepare students to navigate the multiple timelines and plotlines of <em>The Lost Child</em>. We then turn to the book with the help of the discussion questions below. When we begin reading the postwar sections (the stories of Monica, Julius, Ben, and Tommy), I also bring in images and information on the Windrush (&ldquo;The Story of the Windrush&rdquo;), to help students understand the postwar colonial migration that informs Julius&rsquo;s storyline, and I incorporate Cousins (2010) on the Notting Hill Riots to contextualize the racial violence that Julius faces.</p>

					<p>Popular music is central to Ben&rsquo;s coming-of-age sections. When we get to these parts of the novel, students take part in another group analysis activity in which they look up and report back on the lyrics from one of the songs that make up the chapter titles of Ben&rsquo;s sections, connecting these lyrics to events and developments in the storyline, and linking them to the novel&rsquo;s characters. We then read a brief excerpt from S&aacute;nchez-Palencia (2020) that considers the significance of music in Ben&rsquo;s sections and relates it to Paul Gilroy&rsquo;s discussion of music in <em>The Black Atlantic.</em></p>

					<p>In my experience, this has been an exciting and generative pairing to discuss with students. However, one limitation of this pairing is that both <em>Wuthering Heights</em> and <em>The Lost Child</em> are rather bleak books. Focusing on histories of enslavement in both novels, as important and necessary as this is, could lead to discussions in which students primarily associate both works&rsquo; depiction of Blackness with suffering and abjection. To address this, it is important that this pairing not be the only occasion in the semester in which students read and talk about Black characters and historical figures. In the contexts of this Brontës class, for example, we also discuss Christophine&rsquo;s social authority in <em>Wide Sargasso Sea</em>, and close out the term with a reading of Namwali Serpell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Double Men,&rdquo; about a Zambian bonding ceremony and a deception that upends the lives of two female friends, from the collection <em>Reader, I Married Him </em>(2016). The sources in the &ldquo;Black British History&rdquo; section of the annotated bibliography below offer more insights into the lives of Black British people in the time periods of <em>Wuthering Heights</em> and <em>The Lost Child</em> and are immensely helpful to discuss with students. The final adaptation assignment also offers students more opportunities to independently research work by Black artists and writers.</p>

						<h4 id="activity">Activity: Analysis of Digital Artifacts from the <em>Understanding Slavery Initiative</em></h4>
							<ol>
								<li>In small groups, please read and discuss Lunt&rsquo;s essay <a href="https://theblackcurriculum.com/blog/liverpool-historic-links-to-slavery">&ldquo;Liverpool&rsquo;s historical links to slavery is something everyone should learn about&rdquo;</a> from <em>The Black Curriculum </em>and "<a href="https://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/history-of-slavery/transatlantic-slave-trade">The Transatlantic Slave Trade</a>"&nbsp;from the <em>National Museums Liverpool&nbsp;</em>website.</li>

								<li>Then, spend some time examining <a href="https://understandingslavery.com/artefacts/">digital artefacts</a> from the <em>Understanding Slavery Initiative </em>(please note that images may be disturbing). Two items to mention include "<a href="https://understandingslavery.com/artefact/description-of-a-slave-ship-about-1788/">Description of a slave ship, c.1788</a>,"&nbsp;about the slave ship Brookes, built in Liverpool in the 1780s, and perhaps the "<a href="https://understandingslavery.com/artefact/silver-whip/">Silver whip</a>." Time permitting, students might also look at pictures and descriptions of Liverpool <a href="https://historicengland.org.uk/research/inclusive-heritage/the-slave-trade-and-abolition/sites-of-memory/slave-traders-and-plantation-wealth/liverpool-and-the-north-west/">buildings</a> and <a href="https://historicengland.org.uk/research/inclusive-heritage/the-slave-trade-and-abolition/read-the-signs/">street signs</a> that are connected to the slave trade.</li>
								
								<li>As a class, prepare to discuss Mr. Earnshaw&rsquo;s trip to Liverpool and his and his family&rsquo;s first encounter with Heathcliff in Vol. I, Chap. IV. Are there gaps or omissions in this account? What questions does this account raise for you as a reader? How do you interpret young Catherine&rsquo;s request for a whip in light of the artefacts? What questions do you have about Heathcliff&rsquo;s unknown past in these passages?</li>
							</ol>
					</section>

					<section aria-labelledby="discussion_1">
						<h4 id="discussion">Discussion Questions</h4>
							<ol>
								<li>How do the Earnshaws and Nelly react to Heathcliff and what roles do racism, racial violence, and notions of white supremacy play in their treatment of him? In what ways does Heathcliff internalize these harmful ideas? (See, for example, their reaction to meeting Heathcliff in Vol. I, Chap. IV, and Heathcliff and Nelly discussing his dress and appearance in Vol. I, Chap VII).</li>
								<li>Throughout the book, characters make various attempts to define Heathcliff&rsquo;s racial and ethnic identity, and his background is much debated. What do the characters&rsquo; language about Heathcliff&rsquo;s racial and ethnic identity tell us about the workings of white supremacy and the insistence on racial categorizations and hierarchies? At the same time, how does the ambiguity of Heathcliff&rsquo;s origins trouble those same categories? (See, for example, Lockwood&rsquo;s description of Heathcliff in Vol. I, Chap. 1, the scene of Heathcliff&rsquo;s arrival at Wuthering Heights, the Lintons&rsquo; reaction to Heathcliff in Vol. I, Chap. VI, Nelly&rsquo;s speech to Heathcliff in Vol. I, Chap. VII).</li>
								<li>In what ways is Catherine&rsquo;s stay at the Lintons&rsquo; a lesson in the inculcation of genteel white femininity? How has her attitude towards Heathcliff changed when she returns home? (See Vol. I, Chap. VII).</li>
								<li>How does Heathcliff&rsquo;s revenge plot interact with contemporary fears of rebellions against enslavers and/or against British imperial rule?</li>
								<li>Discuss the ending of <em>Wuthering Heights</em>. Is this a happy ending? If so, for whom? What characters and plotlines are elevated, and which fall away? What roles do haunting and the local accounts of Heathcliff&rsquo;s ghost play into all this?</li>

					<p>&ldquo;This seven-year old dark stranger, whom Mr Earnshaw &lsquo;rescued&rsquo; from the streets of Liverpool in 1771, was one of the first literary characters to seize my imagination&hellip;. From the vantage point of my bench [in Liverpool], I look around and am suddenly convinced that it must have been down here, by the docks, that Mr Earnshaw spotted the scrawny dark apparition named Heathcliff. And, not for the first time in my life, I close my eyes and try to solve the puzzle of this seven-year-old boy&rsquo;s origins.&rdquo;</p>

					<section aria-labelledby="discussion_2">
						<h4 id="discussion_2">Discussion Questions</h4>
							<ol>
								<li>In the quote above, Phillips imagines a more vivid and detailed past for Heathcliff than we are given access to in <em>Wuthering Heights</em>. What new possibilities does this open up? Which does this set aside? Speculate on some reasons why Phillips may have made this artistic choice.</li>
								<li>How does the novel approach the gaps of <em>Wuthering Heights</em>, especially in its opening chapter about Heathcliff&rsquo;s mother and her history? (See Chap. 1).</li>
								<li>In <a href="https://www.publicbooks.org/yorkshire-calling-an-interviewwith-caryl-phillips/">a 2015 </a><a href="https://www.publicbooks.org/yorkshire-calling-an-interviewwith-caryl-phillips/"><em>Public Books</em></a><a href="https://www.publicbooks.org/yorkshire-calling-an-interviewwith-caryl-phillips/"> interview </a>Philipps says that &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re trying to reclaim a history, as her [<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/44325077">Bront</a><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/44325077">&euml;</a>&rsquo;s] novel is, it doesn&rsquo;t move in a straight line&rdquo; (Phillips, &ldquo;Yorkshire Calling&rdquo;). What do you make of this idea? How does this idea of non-linearity inform <em>The Lost Child&rsquo;s </em>multiple timelines (Heathcliff and his mother in Liverpool in the late 1700s, Emily <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/44325077">Bront</a><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/44325077">&euml;</a> on her deathbed in 1848, Julius, Monica, Ben, and Tommy in Leeds and London in the postwar period)?</li>
								<li>How does the novel depict independence movements and Julius&rsquo;s involvement in these movements? What sorts of threats and dangers does he face as a Black man in London? (See, for example, his involvement with the Anti-Colonial Club, the reference to the Notting Hill Riots, and his role as a party organizer in Section II).</li>
								<li>What struggles do his and Monica&rsquo;s children Ben and Tommy face as biracial children and how do these interact with Heathcliff&rsquo;s story? (See, for example, their experiences at their new school and with Mrs. Swinson in Section V).&nbsp;</li>
								<li>What dangers are now made more explicit in sections IX and X? Why does the novel close with the disturbing scene of Mr. Earnshaw and Heathcliff on the moors? How does this interact with the representations of the moors and the ending of <em>Wuthering Heights</em>?</li>
							</ol>
					</section>

					<section aria-labelledby="activity_2">
						<h4 id="activty_2">Activity: Analysis of Popular Music and Lyrics</h4>
						<ol>
							<li>In pairs or small groups, choose one song referenced in Ben&rsquo;s coming-of-age chapters (Section VI), listen to the song, look up the lyrics, and analyze them. How does this song interact with Ben&rsquo;s story?</li>
							<li>S&aacute;nchez-Palencia writes that:
							&ldquo;Just as, in the wake of slavery, music was an invaluable instrument through which to express the unsayable, Ben is eventually able to revisit his childhood traumas with the help of the interracial repertoire of Pluto Shervington, David Bowie, Freda Payne, and Millie Small. One of the most important aspects in Gilroy&rsquo;s (1993) <em>The Black Atlantic</em> is precisely his focus on music&hellip;because, for him (as for Ben in Phillips&rsquo;s novel), black music defies categorization and symbolizes a hybrid and anti-essentialist notion of race and identity&rdquo; (345-46).</li>
						</ol>

							<p>Discuss this quote in relation to Ben&rsquo;s sections. What (if any) solace do the songs offer as he navigates his journey to adulthood?</p>

					<h3 id="final">Final Assessment: Prompt for Adaptation Assignment</h3>
					<p>For this final assignment, please compose a piece about adapting one of our novels this semester. You may choose from one of the following options:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>In consultation with your instructor, view or read (on your own) an adaptation and write an analysis of how the adaptation reimagines, reworks, or enters into dialogue with the novel the author chooses to adapt. For <em>Wuthering Heights, </em>this might include: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryse_Cond%C3%A9">Maryse Cond&eacute;</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/211001/windward-heights-by-maryse-conde/"><em>Windward Heights</em></a> (1998), set in Cuba and Guadaloupe, Andrea Arnold&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1181614/">2011 film adaptation</a>, or Barnett Freedman&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/illustrations-to-wuthering-heights-by-barnett-freedman">1940 illustrations to </a><a href="https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/illustrations-to-wuthering-heights-by-barnett-freedman"><em>Wuthering Heights. </em></a>You can find a preliminary list of <em>Wuthering Heights </em>adaptations <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptations_of_Wuthering_Heights">here</a>, but you may discover others in your research.</li>
							<li>In consultation with your instructor, explain how you would craft an adaptation to one of the works. Your response should include one sample scene of your planned adaptation and a brief craft commentary that discusses the choices you made and why.</li>
						</ol>

						<p>Some questions to consider:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Which scenes or passages did the artist / director / writer choose to focus on?</li>
								<li>Which characters were emphasized? What aspects of plot, character, and/or setting are reinterpreted or remade in the adaptation?</li>
								<li>What artistic / craft choices did the artist / director / writer make? (Examples: writing in a certain POV, using heavy shading in an illustration, focusing on setting in a film, etc.)</li>
								<li>What new considerations, contexts, themes, and/or characters does the author introduce and why?</li>

					<h3 id="approaches">Additional Approaches</h3>
					<p>This lesson plan could be further fleshed out to include other important intertextual works, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryse_Cond%C3%A9">Maryse Cond&eacute;</a>&rsquo;s <em>Windward Heights </em>(1998) and Andrea Arnold&rsquo;s 2011 film adaptation of <em>Wuthering Heights</em>, or by incorporating additional biographical materials, such as the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/44325077">Bront</a><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/44325077">&euml;</a> sisters&rsquo; juvenilia or additional nonfiction essays by Phillips. Or, for an upper-level or graduate seminar, students could investigate how anticolonial writers, in Mufti&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;embraced&hellip;their relation to the Victorian past as a way to negate it&rdquo; (395) by reading Mufti&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hating Victorian Studies Properly&rdquo; (2020) in conversation with C.L.R.

							<p>This syllabus examines legacies of white supremacy in Victorian texts through the framework of Black studies, Black feminism, and postcolonial theory. Weeks 7, 8, and 9 of the syllabus (pp. 6-7) address the body, kin, and the environment in <em>Wuthering Heights. </em>These weeks provide useful discussion questions on these topics for students, as well as links or references to framing critical readings by Christina Sharpe and Kathryn Yusoff.</p>

							<h5 id="meyer"><p>Meyer, Susan. <em>Imperialism at Home: Race and Victorian Women&rsquo;s Fiction</em>. Cornell University Press, 1996, pp. 96-125.</p></h5>

							<p>Meyer reads Heathcliff&rsquo;s insurgency as a striking instance of reverse imperialism that brings colonial violence and the colonial gaze to the English domestic interior, reading <em>Wuthering Heights</em> in the context of the Opium Wars, Liverpool&rsquo;s slave trade, the American Revolution, Canadian discontent, and uprisings in the West Indies. Meyer also interprets the novel&rsquo;s resistance to closure as a satire of how fiction can work to quash socially resistant energies, which is helpful in discussing the ending of <em>Wuthering Heights</em> with students. Meyer&rsquo;s interpretation can be usefully contrasted with Watson&rsquo;s and excerpted and given to students.</p>

							<h5 id="Sneidern"><p>Sneidern, Maja-Lisa von. "<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/30030265?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents">Wuthering Heights and the Liverpool Slave Trade</a>."&nbsp;<em>ELH, </em>vol. 62, no. 1, 1995, pp. 171-96.</p></h5>

							<p>von Sneidern sets <em>Wuthering Heights </em>in the context of slavery, abolition, and myths of racial superiority in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, arguing for the novel as a &ldquo;site in which the problematics of an Anglo-Saxon mythology saddled with the fact of slavery and the "fact" of race are revealed, if not resolved&rdquo; (174). This article offers valuable historical context for discussing the novel, such as James Somersett&rsquo;s 1771 case against his enslaver, Somerset vs. Stewart, in which the judge ruled on whether an enslaved person who came to England could be forcibly removed and sent away for resale, a case that was just decided at the time of Mr. Earnshaw&rsquo;s journey to Liverpool (172).</p>

							<h5 id="watson"><p>Watson, Reginald. "<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/44325077">Images of Blackness in the Works of Charlotte and Emily Bront</a><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/44325077">&euml;</a>,"&nbsp;<em>CLA Journal</em>, vol. 44, no. 4, 2001, pp. 451-70.</p></h5>

							<p>Watson argues that the depiction of Heathcliff in <em>Wuthering Heights </em>reveals Brontë's&nbsp;racist attitudes towards people perceived as &ldquo;Black&rdquo; or &ldquo;other,&rdquo; reading his character through the lens of Sterling Brown&rsquo;s analysis of the tragic mulatto stereotype. Watson compares the depiction of this stereotype in <em>Wuthering Heights </em>to the portrayal of Bertha Mason in <em>Jane Eyre</em>, and makes a strong case for Heathcliff&rsquo;s character as a troubling &ldquo;reinforcement of the idea that in one of mixed heritage, the &lsquo;white&rsquo; side gains, but the &lsquo;black&rsquo; side destroys what is gained&rdquo; (459-460). Watson concludes that the Brontë sisters&rsquo; established place in the literary canon should not lead readers to overlook these negative depictions. Watson&rsquo;s interpretation can be fruitfully contrasted with Meyer&rsquo;s, and excerpted and given to students.</p>
