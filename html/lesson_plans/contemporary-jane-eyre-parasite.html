					<section aria-labelledby="overview">
						<h4 id="overview">Overview</h4>
						<p>In this lesson plan I detail the 100-level composition course, &ldquo;Imagining Identity,&rdquo; which I have taught in the Expository Writing Program at the University of Washington in Seattle. Rather than centering literary analysis and adaptation as frameworks, the course is grounded in feminist theory, especially Black feminist theories of intersectionality, and autoethnography as a compositional practice.</p>

						<p>The course is organized around three texts: Patricia Park&rsquo;s <em>Re Jane </em>(2015), Charlotte Bront&euml;&rsquo;s <em>Jane Eyre </em>(1847), and Bong Joon Ho&rsquo;s film <em>Parasite</em> (2019). These mutually illuminating narratives ground students&rsquo; investigations into intersectional identity and its imbrication in communities, which is carried out through discussion and autoethnographic writing, as well as podcasting (see &ldquo;Assignments&rdquo;).&nbsp;</p>

						<p>I owe the pairing of <em>Re Jane</em> and <em>Jane Eyre</em> to Olivia Loksing Moy&rsquo;s (2020) inspired article in the &ldquo;Undisciplining Victorian Studies&rdquo; special issue of <em>Victorian Studies</em>. On the surface a Korean-American adaptation of <em>Jane Eyre</em>, <em>Re Jane</em> is also a sophisticated and relatable novel about hybrid identity, gender performance, and cross-cultural comparison. It is relatable in a few important ways: it uses clear, contemporary language that students won&rsquo;t struggle with, compared to <em>Jane Eyre</em>. It is also culturally legible to students from Asian American communities, and those from outside them find familiarity in the early-20s life scenarios it depicts. <em>Re Jane</em> is not just an intertext for the &ldquo;canonical&rdquo; novel, but rather a lens which focuses transcultural and transhistorical issues of gender, race, and social class, as well as a formally supple example for students to refer to in their own autoethnographic writing.</p>

						<p>Connecting Victorian and twenty-first century imaginaries of race undisciplines normative Victorian studies practices by reorienting toward a critique of &ldquo;White time,&rdquo; in Charles W. Mills&rsquo; (2014) phrase. Scholarship and teaching on nineteenth-century literature and culture extensively critique imperial, liberal, and &ldquo;exploitative bourgeois class temporal regime[s]&rdquo; (28). But this pair of texts facilitates discussions about the limits of &ldquo;normative discourse of the non-enslaved, the non-expropriated, and the non-victims of genocide&hellip;whose normative temporality need pay no attention in determining questions of justice to [the] past&rdquo; in Victorian studies (40).</p>

						<p>Screening <em>Parasite </em>at the end of the course brings the discussion right up to date in the 2020s and, uncannily, closer to the concerns of <em>Jane Eyre</em>. The film facilitates a synthesis of the course readings and writing assignments. <em>Parasite </em>allows me to frame <em>Re Jane</em> and <em>Jane Eyre</em> as fantasies about social mobility across discrete social spaces propelled by individual will. Both novels propose that, if you are able to become your authentic self, you will be able to navigate the hierarchies of unequal societies.</p>

						<p>But <em>Parasite</em> is about economic forces so overwhelmingly unequal that the types of mobility <em>Jane Eyre</em> and <em>Jane Re</em> engineer for themselves are only possible through deceit. In the film&rsquo;s (and our own) radically segregated world of post-Great Recession capitalism, you have to become an inauthentic self in order to survive. Together, these texts implore students to consider their own privilege and the hazards of an individualist outlook.</p>
					</section>

					<section aria-labelledby="outcomes">
						<h4 id="outcomes">Learning outcomes</h4>
						<p>It is important to clarify the difference between the course&rsquo;s learning outcomes and my goals as a Victorianist. My intellectual aims &ndash; decentering and reframing the white canonical novelist while investigating how (and if) Bront&euml;&rsquo;s novel still speaks to students now &ndash; inform every choice I made in designing the class. But these aims are necessarily subordinate to the learning outcomes for students: first, developing a critical perspective on lived experience and society by thinking about their multivalent identities and, second, complicating students&rsquo; sense of identity&rsquo;s transcultural and transhistorical connections.</p>

						<p>The readings and assignments facilitate what Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak (1988) calls strategic essentialism: a temporary and self-aware focus on one aspect of identity for the purposes of analysis and, ultimately, political community building in order to redress inequalities within subcultures and society at large (202-207, esp. 205). I am mindful of how problematic essentialist thinking can be; indeed, <em>Parasite</em> can be read as a cautionary tale about strategic essentialism adopted in bad faith.<sup><sup>i</sup></sup></p>

						<p>In discussions and feedback, I encourage students&rsquo; own sense of the inadequacy of static definitions of identity, emphasizing instead flux and contingency while maintaining the analytical value of isolating a variable to consider it singly without losing sight of its intersectional affiliations. Extended first-person narratives, like the novels we read in class, become a useful model for understanding the fluidity of identity formation and reformation in time and between social/cultural spaces.</p>
					</section>

					<section aria-labelledby="rationale">
						<h4 id="rationale">Rationale for cluster groupings</h4>
						<p>My goals as a scholar and a teacher align and become flush thanks to Moy&rsquo;s ingenious strategy of reading <em>Re Jane </em>before <em>Jane Eyre</em> in the course. In other words, the simple act of reversing the text-adaptation sequence &ndash; using <em>Re Jane </em>as a lens through which to view <em>Jane Eyre</em> &ndash; keeps me (especially) and my students from unthinkingly genuflecting to <em>Jane Eyre</em> as a Great Novel.</p>

						<p>In the classroom, I tell students I&rsquo;m not interested in <em>Jane Eyre</em> as a canonical &ldquo;classic of Western civilization&rdquo;: I&rsquo;m interested in what the novel in part as a tool to think with. I try to get students to &ldquo;buy in&rdquo; to the reading these books by saying that, if this book seems to have nothing to do with you, first, let&rsquo;s discuss that, because it&rsquo;s important and interesting. Second, in the case of <em>Jane Eyre</em>, we live in a &ldquo;global Anglophone&rdquo; socioeconomic system contoured by the nineteenth-century British world-system.</p>

						<p>For those reasons, it is worth examining that world-system&rsquo;s cultural artefacts from students&rsquo; own subject positions. This is a starting point for critiquing that world-system and its lingering grip on the planet. In the context of a 100-level composition course, modeling this disposition toward literary texts builds toward &ldquo;close reading&rdquo; of students&rsquo; own experiences.</p>

						<p><em>Re Jane</em> is not just a set of binoculars for <em>Jane Eyre</em>, however. It does important work all its own, which is easier to see when it is put first on the syllabus. One reason I thought this pairing would work well in my institutional context is because a significant proportion of my students are from Asian-American and Asian backgrounds.</p>

						<p>The experiences described in <em>Re Jane</em> align and pull against students&rsquo; own experiences in productive ways. This facilitates identification with the novel&rsquo;s characters as well as the subtle delineation between cultural identities, which is helpful in understanding a concept as variegated as &ldquo;intersectionality.&rdquo; But as with any interesting novel, identification is only the beginning. <em>Re Jane</em>&rsquo;s narration is both approachable and conducive to articulating fundamental narrative concepts like &ldquo;diegesis&rdquo; and &ldquo;realism.&rdquo;</p>

						<p>As readers of this lesson plan think about how to migrate this cluster of texts to other institutions, care must be taken to make sure Asian American and Asian students are not put in the position of acting as bridges to understanding for white students. In my own situation, I emphasize my own responsibility as a white person in intersectional spaces and the collective nature of the work of understanding identity, as well as undisciplining our scholarly practices.</p>

					<h3 id="key-ideas">Key Ideas and Critical Frameworks</h3>

					<section aria-labelledby="idea-1">
						<h4 id="idea-1">Key idea: realism and the politics of the everyday</h4>
						<p>Realism in particular becomes a through line in the course, linking the novels to the autoethnographic writing assignments via a politics of the ordinary. Realism makes the radical political point that the ordinary experiences of ordinary people are of social and aesthetic significance.</p>

						<p>But I don&rsquo;t turn to George Eliot, the <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>, or even <em>Jane Eyre</em> to illustrate this at first. Instead, we spend time talking about the culturally-specific Korean concepts that shape <em>Re Jane</em>&rsquo;s ethics, including <em>nunchi </em>(intuitive interpersonal awareness), <em>jung</em> (deep-seated regard for another person), and &ldquo;good family education.&rdquo;</p>

						<p>In making connections between the novel and the writing assignments, we talk about the culturally-specific lenses students know from their backgrounds, how they might be applied by critically interpreting experiences using the methods learned from examining cultural texts, and what the unstated social assumptions underlying those lenses might be &ndash; that is, what they reveal about the values of those communities. <em>Re Jane</em> exposes students to literary sophistication while also modeling how to develop a critical subject position all their own in the autoethnographic writing assignments.</p>
					</section>

					<section aria-labelledby="idea-2">
						<h4 id="idea-2">Key idea: using literary texts to teach critical positionality</h4>
						<p>Adaptations do also have a way of &ldquo;shed[ding] light on what was suppressed in their antecedents,&rdquo; as Aviva Briefel (2021) puts it. Moy points out that <em>Re Jane</em> critiques gynocentric feminism through the character of Jane, who intuits that this type of abstract, white feminism is inadequate to her lived experience as a working-class Korean-American woman (414-15). This critique becomes an optic for <em>Jane Eyre</em>, in which the white heroine&rsquo;s individual freedom is scaffolded on the subjugation of Bertha Mason as well as that of the Black and brown people whose forced labor produced the Eyre and Rochester families&rsquo; generational wealth.</p>

						<p>Together, <em>Re Jane </em>and <em>Jane Eyre </em>permit discussion of what liberatory politics and ethics look like, which emerge from real communities and are equal to their complexities. Students perform a double movement, developing their own interpretive practices as they apply them to cultural artefacts and their own experiences.</p>

						<p>Both novels, viewed through the frameworks discussed below and paired with the writing assignments, reinforce the idea that critical perspective emerges from the student&rsquo;s own subject position and is augmented, but not determined, by concepts like intersectionality, rather than by adopting my type of critical positionality as the instructor. I want students to see that their critical understandings of society emerge from the lived experiences of being individuals in communities and are refined by theory, rather than learned by rote from some sort of predetermined set of discipline-specific lenses (&ldquo;this is how we do things in literary studies,&rdquo; &ldquo;this is how we do things in anthropology&rdquo;).</p>
					</section>

					<section aria-labelledby="framework-1">
						<h4 id="framework-1">Framework for class discussions: intersectional feminism and cultural comparison</h4>
						<p>In order to think with these texts about identity and its imbrication in communities, I frame the course through the concepts of intersectionality and autoethnography. Early on, I articulate two main points about intersectionality. First, intersectionality is a concept that has high political stakes for addressing inequality and legal legibility in society. Kimberl&eacute; Crenshaw&rsquo;s (1989) classic example of the legal invisibility of Black women makes this starkly clear: the contrast between the &ldquo;multidimensionality of Black women&rsquo;s experience with the single-axis analysis that distorts these experiences&rdquo; (139). Quite frequently, this core concept of intersectionality is one that students have heard of in popular culture or conversations about social justice.</p>

						<p>Second, intersectionality is also a way to understand the complexity of identity: how the individual sense of self is rooted in multiple intersecting communities, and how privilege is accumulated but also mitigated in dynamic ways. I try to disabuse students of a notion that can follow from the first point, which is that intersectionality itself &ldquo;is a problem in our society.&rdquo; Instead, while making sure the political consequences never disappear, I describe intersectionality as a neutral framework for articulating a critical understanding of things students already know. Their identities are complex, the dynamics of their communities are complex, and &ndash; by teasing apart aspects of those identities and dynamics without losing sight of their interconstitutiveness &ndash; students can gain insight into big social questions including race, nationality, gender, and class.</p>

						<p>One student wrote about being a discriminated against as a racially minoritized American, interrogating the idea of being a &ldquo;<em>real</em> <em>American</em>&rdquo; and acknowledging the positionality that came from being considered a &ldquo;model minority&rdquo; and thus more &ldquo;<em>real American</em>&rdquo; than others:</p>

							<blockquote>My experiences were unfair, but these experiences instilled a passion to be educated about social issues. It is important that I recognize the privilege I possess as well: I am a U.S. born heterosexual Asian woman who is pursuing higher education. I am less likely to be killed by police, I am less likely to experience hate crimes, I am more likely to be given job opportunities. While I have these privileges, I will not say that issues like unequal access to education, police brutality, and unequal unemployment are not my problem. If I were to ignore these issues, I would only be contributing to the problem. America itself, American systems, and the American idea of being a <em>real American</em> should not be the same as it was centuries ago. Change begins with the recognition and education about America&rsquo;s prevalent social issues.</blockquote>
					</section>

					<section aria-labelledby="framework-2">
						<h4 id="framework-2">Framework for writing assignments: autoethnography</h4>
						<p>If intersectionality is the paradigm for our class discussions of identity, then autoethnography is the method we use to investigate it through the writing assignments. The notion of the &ldquo;participant observer&rdquo; is a point of connection between nineteenth-century social sciences and realist novels including <em>Jane Eyre</em>, as James Buzard (2005) has shown. Autoethnographic writing allows students to develop a critical sense of their own &ldquo;insider&rsquo;s outsideness,&rdquo; honed by reading the literary texts (209). Rhetoric and composition scholars teach us that autoethnography is also a versatile framework for academic writing because it activates the connection between the personal and the critical. Melissa Tombro&rsquo;s (2016) scholarship was particularly formative for me in designing this course.&nbsp;</p>

						<p>Through two short sketches and two versions of a medium-length essay (the second extensively revised &ndash; see the &ldquo;Assignments and Assessment&rdquo;) students begin by describing how being a part of a particular subculture has shaped their identities and steadily develop a critical perspective on these experiences. The goal of this process, culminating in the medium-length essay, is to step back to reflect on and analyze what your experiences mean by asking, for example: where do values or practices come from in the subculture? What might be some of the unstated cultural or social assumptions that this subculture is founded on? For example, the implicit relations in terms of gender, race, or class on which the idea of &ldquo;normality&rdquo; in this community is based? How and why experiences, attitudes, and practices differ from dominant American culture?</p>

						<p>Recently, ethical issues with autoethnography as a social science research method has created controversy (see, e.g., Mohammed et al., &ldquo;Open letter&rdquo;). As a composition practice, Tombro provides advice on helping students feel comfortable with disclosure of personal information and ethical practices in engaging with their chosen subcultures. She emphasizes that instructors should help students navigate how to pick an autoethnographic topic which &ldquo;interests them and increase their understanding of the subculture while staying within their comfort zone&rdquo; (Tombro 43).</p>

						<p>The first rule of such writing should be &ldquo;do no harm,&rdquo; both personally and within the subculture. In assignment prompts and discussions with students I remind them that they are always in complete control of what they disclose and that I want them to feel secure in this knowledge. Following Tombro, I emphasize students&rsquo; agency in choosing to write about triggering topics and experiences:</p>

						<blockquote>When students decide to write on a topic such as abuse, sexual violence or experiencing the death of someone close to them, I try to have a one-on-one conversation about the choice of topic early in the drafting process. In no way do I wish to discourage students from choosing a topic if they feel this is a good time to explore it. Instead, in these meetings, I invite them to write about these topics and also advise them that sometimes exploring these topics can be difficult because they will relive them again and again as they revise their writing. They will even be critiqued on how they recount something very personal and painful, which can be difficult. Ultimately, I leave the decision to the students. (62)</blockquote>

						<p>These issues should be addressed at the outset of the assignment sequence and repeatedly throughout the course.</p>

						<p>Extensibility is a key feature of autoethnography as a method in the writing classroom. The formal and analytical possibilities of autoethnographic writing are diverse, as are the ways that questions can be posed. I have only ever taught &ldquo;Imagining Identity&rdquo; during the Covid-19 emergency, so the types of autoethnographic writing students have undertaken has been relatively modest in terms of &ldquo;embeddedness,&rdquo; as the assignment prompt summaries show. But in an extended assignment sequence, or one made up of more short assignments, the sky is the limit. Tombro gives examples of writing assignments involving interviews with community members, about significant spaces or events, about forms of deep observation, and so on.</p>

						<p>Throughout the term, I describe discussing the novels and writing the autoethnographic essays as linked processes of close reading. In the writing, I ask students to transfer the habit of slow, curious attention from the literary to the social, close reading their communities and experiences the way we have been close reading the books.</p>
