					<h3 id="goals">Goals and Questions</h3>
					
					<p>In times of significant political unrest and social inequality, the powerful rhetoric of talented speakers has often sparked revolutions. Such rhetoric has historically intertwined with the struggles of marginalized communities, particularly people of color, who have used persuasive language to resist oppression from governmental and societal forces. Figures such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X played pivotal roles in the civil rights movements of the 1960s and beyond through their speeches.</p>
					
					<p>This two-week lesson plan (or unit) aims to, first, define rhetoric and, second, explore its historical significance in combating oppression and effecting tangible change. Additionally, the lesson plan provides students with tools to enhance their own rhetorical writing skills.</p>
					
					<p>Through this lesson plan, students discuss rhetoric's purpose and historical context, particularly its centrality within African American and South Asian communities. Furthermore, they critically examine the boundaries and potential limitations of rhetorical strategies. This exploration also prompts questions about the transition from passive resistance to active participation in movements directed towards racial and social justice, including the necessity of taking to the streets to confront injustices head-on.</p>

					<section aria-labelledby="overview">
						<h4 id="overview">Overview</h4>
						
						<p>This lesson plan is designed for high-school-level students. Based on how the readings and writing assignments are scaffolded, the lesson plan could be appropriate for a 9-12th grade range, but would be especially useful in upper-level high school classrooms. (Note: This <a aria-label="External Link" href="http://govdocs.nebraska.gov/epubs/E2000/B109-2013.pdf">guide</a> [PDF] shows how one may approach changing the current standards for this lesson plan into a different grade-level than the current standards set at the 10th grade level.)</p>
						
						<p>Currently structured for two weeks, this lesson plan has the flexibility for expansion by incorporating additional activities, such as writing a speech or essay using rhetorical strategies and delving deeper into the suggested readings. Conversely, the lesson plan could be streamlined into a one-week format if the emphasis shifted toward defining rhetoric and providing a few examples rather than how to implement rhetoric into one's writing practices. The versatile nature of this lesson plan allows for customization based on the depth of exploration desired within the given timeframe.</p>

					<section aria-labelledby="week-one">
						<h4 id="week-one">Week One: What Is Rhetoric and Why Does it Matter?</h4>
						
						<p>In the first week of this course, students delve into the fundamental concepts of rhetoric and its indispensable role in driving social change. Through interactive discussions and curated resources, students develop a solid understanding of rhetorical strategies and their historical significance.</p>
						
						<p>To kickstart this exploration, students engage with the article “What is Rhetoric?” which offers a comprehensive yet accessible overview of rhetorical principles and their evolution over time. Additionally, a TED talk focusing on the application of rhetoric not only reinforces these concepts, but also seeks to inspire students by showcasing real-world examples of rhetoric in action.</p>
						
						<p>Furthermore, this week features discussions on race relations in the United States, particularly highlighting the pivotal role of Martin Luther King Jr. in utilizing rhetoric to effectuate tangible change during the civil rights movement. Students analyze King's rhetorical strategies and their impact, laying the groundwork for a deeper understanding of the potential of rhetoric as a tool for activism.</p>
						
						<p>Moreover, the week explores the perspectives of Malcolm X, whose more radical approach provides a contrasting viewpoint to King's strategies. Students also look at political activist and philosopher Angela Davis and the rhetorical tactics she used to enact social change slightly after King and X’s time. This comparative analysis seeks to prompt discussions on the various tools and approaches that can complement rhetoric in the pursuit of social change.</p>
						
						<p>Below are the selected Nebraska English Language Arts (ELA) standards for the tenth grade that are implemented within this lesson. The Nebraska Department of Education provides <a aria-label="External Link" href="https://www.education.ne.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ELA-Standards-2021-8-25-22.pdf">further information</a> (PDF).

						<h4 id="week-two">Week Two: How to Use Rhetoric</h4>
						
						<p>In the second week of this course, students embark on a deeper exploration of rhetorical strategies, focusing specifically on the persuasive tools of ethos, pathos, and logos. The primary objective is to equip students with the skills necessary to enhance their own writing abilities through the application of rhetorical strategies.</p>
						
						<p>Moreover, this week broadens the scope of analysis to examine rhetoric on a global scale, looking at the famed Indian activists Sri Aurobindo and Sarojini Naidu and their rhetorical abilities. This exploration seeks to prompt discussions on the diverse cultural perspectives and values that shape rhetorical practices in India, thereby fostering a deeper understanding of global communication dynamics.</p>
						
						<p>An integral component of this week's activities is the cultivation of a space for personal reflection. Students are encouraged to share their insights and contributions, and the week fosters open dialogue on topics of personal significance. Emphasis is placed on the importance of respectful disagreement within a professional academic setting, which allows for meaningful exchange of ideas while maintaining a supportive and inclusive learning environment.</p>
						
						<p>In this final week, a summative assessment would be most beneficial. Note: As a scholar examining education as a carceral system, I do not design or assign summative assessments in my own classroom. However, I recognize the constraints and requirements that come with teaching in public school systems and believe an assessment that requires students to not only define and identify different rhetorical strategies, but also implement them within their own writing would be most appropriate to conclude this lesson plan with.</p>
