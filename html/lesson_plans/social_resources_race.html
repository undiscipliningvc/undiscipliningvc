					<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
				
					<p>Discussions of race relations in the high school classroom are an increasingly challenging yet integral part of fostering a more inclusive and empathetic society. As educators, navigating these conversations requires careful preparation, cultural sensitivity, and a commitment to creating a safe and respectful learning environment.</p>
				
					<p>Below are suggested resources for educators on ways to facilitate conversations about race and social justice within the classroom. These resources draw from the expertise of fellow scholars and educators who have dedicated their work to understanding and addressing issues of racial equity in education. While these materials offer specific insights and strategies, they are not exhaustive, nor are they intended to serve as definitive guides. Instead, they represent a foundation upon which educators can build, adapt, and refine their approaches based on their own classroom dynamics and the needs of their students.</p>
				
					<p>It is important to note that successful discussions of race and social justice require a classroom predicated on mutual respect and reciprocity between teachers and students. Educators must remain open to learning alongside their students, acknowledging that these conversations can be deeply personal and evoke a range of emotions.</p>
