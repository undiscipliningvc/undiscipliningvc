					<h3 id="goals">Goals and Questions</h3>

					<p>In this lesson plan, the aim is to delve into the multifaceted concept of nationalism, examining its implications within modern-day America and on a global scale, particularly during the nineteenth century. The primary objective is to foster critical discussions about nationalism, while also exploring other ideologies associated with nationalism.</p>

					<p>During the first week, the lesson plan defines nationalism and stages critical discussions about its benefits and drawbacks. The focus is on analyzing how nationalism may benefit certain groups while neglecting the well-being of historically marginalized groups. Additionally, the lesson plan considers alternative perspectives and potential considerations that could make nationalism more inclusive and beneficial for all groups.</p>

					<p>The second-week centers on the inception and implementation of Black nationalism on a global scale. The lesson plan for the second week explores how Black nationalism differs from other forms of nationalism and its significance in responding to global nationalist ideologies.</p>

					<p>In the final week, the lesson plan sets up a critical and historical analysis of nationalism on a global scale. Central to the discussions are questions surrounding who benefits from nationalism and its impact on society. The aim is to explore the complexities of nationalism, including its origins, cultural ties, and implications for historically marginalized groups.</p>

					<p>Overall, this lesson plan unit aims to encourage students to reflect on their own identities and views on national pride. Through critical analysis and discussion, students gain a deeper understanding of nationalism and its effects on individuals, communities, and nations. The lesson plan also facilitates constructive conversations to promote greater understanding and inclusivity in marginalized communities and beyond.</p>

					<section aria-labelledby="overview">
						<h4 id="overview">Overview</h4>

						<p>This lesson plan is designed for high-school-level students. Given the scaffolding of the readings and writing assignments, the lesson plan could be appropriate for a 9-12th grade range, but would be especially useful in upper-level high school classrooms. <a aria-label="External Link" href="http://govdocs.nebraska.gov/epubs/E2000/B109-2013.pdf">(Note: This guide</a> [PDF] shows how one may approach changing the current standards for this lesson plan into a different grade-level than the current standards set at the 10th grade level.) Currently structured for three weeks, the lesson plan has the flexibility for expansion by incorporating additional activities, such as writing a research essay discussing how nationalism has affected specific historical events. Conversely, the lesson plan could be streamlined into a one-week format if the emphasis shifted towards defining only nationalism along with discussions of how it can negatively and positively affect citizens of the world. The versatile nature of this lesson plan allows for customization based on the depth of exploration desired within the given timeframe.</p>

						<h4 id="week-one">Week One: Defining Nationalism</h4>

						<p>In the first week of this course, students explore the fundamental concepts of nationalism and its historical significance across various countries. Through discussions and activities, students examine how nationalism has manifested within the United States and its impact on significant historical events. Additionally, students have the opportunity to reflect on their personal perspectives and consider whether they identify with nationalist ideologies.</p>

						<p>This week also introduces students to other political ideologies commonly associated with nationalism, including tribalism, patriotism, and globalism. Through discussions and comparative analysis, students gain a deeper understanding of the distinctions between these ideologies and how they intersect with nationalism.</p>

						<p>Furthermore, students engage in conversations about the complexities of nationalism, particularly its historical implications for marginalized communities, including people of color. These discussions should be approached with sensitivity and empathy, fostering an inclusive learning environment where diverse perspectives are valued and respected.</p>

						<p>Below are the selected Nebraska English Language Arts (ELA) standards for the tenth grade that are implemented within this lesson. The Nebraska Department of Education provides <a aria-label="External Link" href="https://www.education.ne.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ELA-Standards-2021-8-25-22.pdf">further information</a> (PDF) about these standards.

						<h4 id="week-two">Week Two: What is Black Nationalism?</h4>

						<p>In contrast to the broader exploration of nationalism in the first week, this week delves into a subset of nationalism unique to Black individuals: Black nationalism. The primary objective is to define and provide a historical understanding of Black nationalism, tracing its development over time.</p>

						<p>Throughout the week, students engage in discussions about the shortcomings of traditional nationalism and explore why there is a perceived need for Black nationalism. This critical examination encourages students to analyze how historical and systemic factors have shaped the emergence of Black nationalist ideologies.</p>

						<p>In addition to defining Black nationalism, the week encourages students to explore the role of historical figures in shaping and embodying these ideologies. However, it is essential that these discussions are conducted respectfully, emphasizing ethical debate practices and avoiding unfounded speculation. By fostering a supportive learning environment, the aim is to encourage thoughtful and nuanced discussions about the complexities of Black nationalism and its historical significance.</p>

						<h4 id="week-three">Week Three: How Does Nationalism Differ on a Global Scale?</h4>

						<p>In the final week of this lesson plan, students engage in a critical analysis of views of nationalism outside of the United States, drawing primarily from Indian civil right’s activist Rabindranath Tagore's extensive book, <em>Nationalism</em> (1917). This book explores diverse perspectives on national pride across various countries, shedding light on how notions of nationalism are often shaped by oppressive forces, particularly in the context of colonialism and imperialism.</p>

						<p>Throughout the week, students grapple with complex questions about the nature of national pride and identity, especially in instances where individuals were forcibly incorporated into nation-states by colonial powers. This inevitably leads to difficult discussions about the legacy of colonialism and its impact on racial identity, both in the United States and in other countries around the world.</p>

						<p>As these sensitive topics are navigated, it is crucial to approach discussions with deep sensitivity toward students and their personal experiences. Recognizing the emotional weight of topics related to colonization and racial identity, it is key to create a supportive and inclusive learning environment where students feel comfortable expressing their thoughts and engaging in respectful dialogue.</p>

						<p>Through these discussions, students gain a deeper understanding of the complexities of nationalism, colonialism, and racial identity on a global scale, fostering critical thinking and empathy toward diverse perspectives.</p>

						<p>In this final week, a summative assessment would be most beneficial. Note: As a scholar examining education as a carceral system, I do not design or assign summative assessments in my own classroom. However, I recognize the constraints and requirements that come with teaching in public school systems and believe an assessment that highlights major discourses surrounding Nationalism and other alternatives as well as the student’s own beliefs on the matter would be appropriate to conclude this lesson plan with.</p>
