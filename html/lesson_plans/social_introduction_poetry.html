					<h3 id="goals">Goals and Questions</h3>
					
					<p>This two-week lesson plan is designed to acquaint students with the fundamentals of poetry while exploring its role as a catalyst for real-world change. The lesson plan gives special attention to helping students understanding how poetry serves as a rhetorical tool for social justice, particularly for marginalized groups.</p>
					
					<p>During the first week, the focus is on delving into poetic elements and exploring various poetry styles. This foundational understanding sets the stage for deeper discussions on the purpose and significance of poetry. The week also challenges the notion of a rigid definition of poetry, encouraging students to engage with its fluidity and complexity.</p>
					
					<p>In the second week, students examine poetry from the Victorian era, known for its adherence to standardized poetic elements. This period offers a tangible framework for identifying and analyzing these elements, providing students with accessible entry points into poetic analysis. Additionally, the week explores colonialism within the Victorian era, and how poetry served as a document of feelings and emotions for people impacted by empire.</p>
					
					<p>Throughout the lesson plan, students are encouraged to reflect on their own positionality and how it shapes their perspectives and writing in everyday life. Facilitating nuanced discussions, particularly regarding the experiences of groups impacted by colonialism, requires sensitivity and openness, especially towards students from these communities. This approach fosters empathy, critical thinking, and a deeper appreciation for the power of poetry in effecting social change.</p>

					<section aria-labelledby="overview">
						<h4 id="overview">Overview</h4>
						
						<p>This lesson plan is designed for high-school-level students. Given the scaffolding of the readings and writing assignments, the lesson plan is appropriate for a 9-12th grade range, but would be especially useful in lower-level high school classrooms. <a aria-label="External Link" href="http://govdocs.nebraska.gov/epubs/E2000/B109-2013.pdf">(Note: This guide</a> [PDF] shows how one may approach changing the current standards for this lesson plan into a different grade-level than the current standards set at the 10th grade level.) Currently structured for two weeks, this lesson plan has the flexibility for expansion by incorporating additional activities, such as looking at modern examples of poetry or a larger focus on creating the student’s own poetry. Conversely, the lesson plan could be streamlined into a one-week format if the emphasis shifted towards generally defining poetic elements as well as how it is used in a variety of poems. The versatile nature of this lesson plan allows for customization based on the depth of exploration desired within the given timeframe.</p>

					<section aria-labelledby="week-one">
						<h4 id="week-one">Week One: What is a Poem?</h4>
						
						<p>Week one of this poetry lesson plan aims to offer a comprehensive introduction to poetic elements and various poetry forms. Tailored for its high school audience, the focus extends beyond defining poetry to exploring its essence and considering what distinguishes a poem. Given the nuanced nature of these discussions, the week maintains flexibility, allowing for exploration rather than rigid definitions.</p>
						
						<p>The majority of the week is dedicated to dissecting the characteristics of poetry through real-world examples, fostering a deeper understanding of its nuances. While the week allocates time for reading poetry, the primary emphasis lies in grasping fundamental principles and concepts inherent to poetry.</p>

						<h4 id="week-two">Week Two: Multicultural Victorian Literature</h4>
						
						<p>Week Two of the poetry unit transitions from foundational knowledge to practical application, as students delve into Victorian-era poetry. This period represents the pinnacle of poetic expression, offering insights into diverse forms and themes. Additionally, students explore how poetry serves as a rhetorical tool for advocating for social justice, examining its role in various societal contexts.</p>
						
						<p>Central to this week's discussions is the multicultural lens through which students analyze poetry. They examine how different cultural groups, particularly those affected by colonialism, employ poetic elements to express their experiences and assert their identities. A comparative study between cultures that endure imperialism and those that do not shed light on nuanced approaches to poetic expression.</p>
						
						<p>Encouraging open dialogue, students are invited to reflect on their personal perspectives and emotions in response to the poetry studied. Emphasizing the voices of multicultural students fosters inclusive discussions that enrich understanding and appreciation of diverse literary traditions.</p>
						
						<p>In this final week, a summative assessment would be most beneficial. Note: As a scholar examining education as a carceral system, I do not design or assign summative assessments in my own classroom. However, I recognize the constraints and requirements that come with teaching in public school systems and believe that an assessment that focuses not as much on the specific terms or their origins and instead asks the students how these structures function and what emotions they evoke would be appropriate to conclude this lesson plan with.</p>

							<p>All of the materials for week two seek to provide examples of poetry from the Victorian era that enact a wide range of poetic elements discussed in the previous week. Two of the poets, E. Pauline Johnson and Rabindranth Tagore, are from minoritized groups and discuss dualities of identity and social injustices in their work. Tennyson, a highly-regarded white British poet of the time, is utilized as a comparison of the other two to further showcase how different topics and poetic elements are used differently.</p>

								<span class="annotation">Written by a group of student researchers at Huron University College, this piece provides context of the Canadian government and the Kanien’keha:Ka (Mohawk) Tribe during the time in which E. Pauline Johnson would have been writing her poetry. This piece also offers key background information that students can use to have a conversation of what rhetorical strategies and messages Johnson chooses to convey within her poetry. Finally, the website defines some words and phrases with which students may be unfamiliar such as “indigeniety” and “First Nations.”</span>

								<span class="annotation">This is an extensive collection of the poems of E. Pauline Johnson (Tekahionwake). There are a wide variety of poems found in this collection that students can use to identify different types of poems. Johnson’s poems also often deal with colonialism, empire, and biraciality and can lead to fruitful discussions regarding how poetry can be used to make students feel and understand perspectives of which the students were unaware. Below is a list of poems from the book I would highly recommend using:</span>
								<ul class="annotation">
									<li>“A Cry from an Indian Wife.” This poem is a dramatic monologue. It tells the story of a Native woman who is upset that her husband is leaving her to fight colonial forces.</li>
							
									<li>“The Onondaga Madonna.” This is a lyric poem that reflects on a Native woman looking at her newborn child and reflecting on how they both are expected to assimilate and lose their culture.</li>
							
									<li>“Ojistoh.” This narrative poem tells the story of a Native woman captured by colonial forces and the story of her subsequent killing of them. The poem plays with perspective and sympathies, which provides a great way to look at poetic elements.</li>
								</ul>

								<span class="annotation">This page introduces the poetry of Rabindranth Tagore. Students can look through the page and find any of Tagore’s poems. The page also offers some background on Tagore, including his significance in the fight against Britian’s colonial rule of India. Below is a list of poems of that are highly recommended.</span>
								<ul class="annotation">
									<li>“Where the Mind is Without Fear.” This lyric poems imagines a world in which colonialism and racism no longer exists, and Tagore’s nation is free.</li>
									
									<li>“Freedom.” This poem is an ode that questions what it would mean to be truly free. Although Tagore speaks of freedom from colonialism, he also argues that one must have a free mind that exists without prejudice.</li>
									
									<li>“The Sunset of a Century.” This poem discusses the end of the 19th century and how colonial rule has affected it as well as what the next century may bring.</li>

							<p>Anonymous. “<a aria-label="External Link" href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/alfred-tennyson">Lord Alfred Tennyson</a>.” <em>Poetry Foundation</em>, 2017.<br/>
								<span class="annotation">This page introduces the poetry of one of the most renowned poets of the Victorian era, Lord Alred Tennyson. Tennyson’s works embody what many consider to this day to be “proper” Victorian poetry. Tennyson also often addresses empire and colonialism, but more so with a romantic eye. A poem that would be particularly interesting to study in the context of this lesson plan is “Ulysses,” which tells the story of a king dreaming of future conquests and pursuits. Students can also look through the page and explore other poems by Tennyson.</span>
