						<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

						<p>This lesson plan invites students and instructors to elucidate a discursive link between British colonial attitudes to the Arabian Peninsula and representations of Arabs and Arabia in literary texts of the Romantic, Victorian, and Edwardian periods.</p>

						<p>Starting with canonical texts of British Romanticism such as Percy Bysshe Shelley's “Ozymandias” (1818) and William Wordsworth's “Arab Dream” (1805), this lesson plan draws attention to Romantic representations of Arabs and Arabia and the ground upon which they are framed.</p>
						
						<p>As students draw out the motifs of the discourse on “Arabia” and on “Arabs” in British Romanticism, they then trace the movements of this discourse in British literatures through the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.</p>
						
						<p>In the process, this lesson plan suggests a shift from an epistemological privileging of the Bedouin in Romantic thought to a racial privileging of the Bedouin in Victorian travel writing, indicative of a wider cultural shift towards positivistic modalities of thought in the later in the nineteenth century. This is done through a reading of Victorian writers and so-called “Arabian adventurers” such as Richard Burton, Gifford Palgrave, and Wilfrid Scawen Blunt.</p>
						
						<p>Finally, this lesson plan traces the discourse on Arabia and Arabs to the early twentieth century and explores how that discourse came to shape British military and colonial policy on the peninsula in the First World War and the Edwardian period. The plan invites students to read the literary work of Mark Sykes and T. E. Lawrence alongside secondary works by historians such as Albert Hourani, Elie Kedourie, and Priya Satia. Here, students are invited to examine the valences of the discourses on Arabs and Arabia in the colonial and geo-political construction of the region by the British in the period, such as the 1916 Sykes-Picot Agreement and the 1917 Balfour Declaration.</p>
					</section>

					<section aria-labelledby="structure">
						<h3 id="structure">Structure and Organisation</h3>

						<p>This lesson plan coordinates material around three historical timings: first, the British Romantic poetry of the early nineteenth century; second, the later nineteenth-century writings on Arabs and the Bedouin; third, the build-up to the major events of the British colonial construction of Arabia in the First World War.</p>

						<p>Our format allows for a genealogical approach to reconstructing discursive structures of feeling. We hope that this will encourage students to broaden their understanding of structural relationships between discourses and material historicity as well as develop an understanding of the network of Romanticism's dominant urges and motifs and the nineteenth century's colonial discourses.</p>
						
						<p>In tracing the themes above through a variety of literatures across a 100-year time span, students are encouraged to think openly about continuities and discontinuities, and to use their contextual knowledge of Romanticisms and Victorianisms. This can be worked though in different ways as an educator sees appropriate. It would be important, however, to question what historical contexts initiate the shifts from Romantic discourses to Victorian ones. This is where the question of the colonial mind, at its widest implications, should come up for analysis.</p>
						
						<p>Our lesson plan is also methodologically flexible. One educator might use this plan as an example of the Foucauldian genealogical method; another might choose to open up historicist methodologies or colonial theory.</p>
						
						<p>Most valuable would be a subtle approach that draws in these different methodological frameworks at different stages in the lesson, according to the students' level of methodological expertise. There might, for example, be classrooms where students already have background knowledge of some of the major work in the fields of Orientalism and postcolonialism. If that is the case, this lesson plan provides empirical material that will allow students to develop the sophistication of their understanding and response to ideas and methods of those fields. However, if students are at an earlier level in their scholarship, this lesson plan would provide a strong starting point for approaching Edward Said's <em>Orientalism</em> (1978), Foucauldian genealogical methodology, and the fields of colonialisms and postcolonialisms.</p>

						<p>Mohammad Sakhnini is a Senior Lecturer in the Department of English at Khalifa University of Science and Technology, Abu Dhabi. He works in the fields of eighteenth-century British literature and culture and travel writing. His book, <em>British Encounters with Syrian-Mesopotamian Overland Routes to India: Rethinking Enlightenment Improvement</em> (1751-1795), has recently been published with Anthem Press (March 2023).</p>

						<p>Lenora Hanson is an Assistant Professor in the Department of English at New York University. Their research focuses on dispossession and enclosure beginning in the Romantic period and as it continues into the present, with particular attention to the way that rhetorical language registers the destruction of non-capitalist forms of life. They recently edited a special issue of <em>Studies in Romanticism</em> entitled “Palestine: Romanticisms Contemporary” and published <em>The Romantic Rhetoric of Accumulation</em> (Stanford University Press, 2022).</p>

						<p>Sarah Copsey Alsader is completing her PhD at the University of Kent on Discourses of Islam in British Romantic Poetry. She has research interests across literature, philosophy, religion and psychology, subjects which are pulled together through questions about metaphysical structures of feeling. She is especially concerned with how such structures of feeling shape and interpellate individuals, are written into and elided in narrative, and construct the world in which we live.</p>
