					<h3 id="overview">Goals, Questions, and Usage</h3>
					<p>This lesson plan centers the idea that the idea of &ldquo;race&rdquo; in the nineteenth century gained its central role in global politics through modes of representation and circulation. The units in this lesson explore the creation of just such a popular representation&mdash;that of Africa as a &ldquo;dark continent&rdquo; full of dangerous beasts, cannibalistic tribes, and wildernesses infested with deadly parasites. Created at the precise moment when Europe shifted gears from the transatlantic slave trade to the scramble for physical control of the African continent (Brantlinger), this racialized image was created and shared across empire&rsquo;s center and peripheries.</p>

					<p>Travelogs, adventure narratives, advertisements, and news united discourses on racial difference, whiteness, indigeneity, labor, extraction, nationalism, and cultural hybridity. In these diverse texts threading together the print networks of the empire, &ldquo;Victorian&rdquo; values and social perceptions remain a powerful connecting thread. Whether they are being upheld, resisted, or mocked, the effects of an ideological frame pervade this multilingual archive of &ldquo;dark continent&rdquo; literature.</p>

					<p>In Section 2, I have provided a range of options in which these readings could be organized&mdash;through lesson plans, discussion questions, and multimodal assignments. Our goal is to discuss the British empire&rsquo;s textual production of Africa as a racialized geography through a vast trove of print materials, illustrations, photographs, newspaper reports, etc. Section 3.1 looks across an array of materials that span the print markets of Britain, the U.S.A, South Africa, East Africa, India, and many other locations.</p>

					<p>This archive introduces students to the ways in which impressions of Africa were crafted in print culture. Discussions of the popularity of David Livingstone&rsquo;s travelogues and cult-like status of Henry Rider Haggard&rsquo;s novels&mdash;and how they have changed since then&mdash;could be enriched by looking at <a href="http://www.visualhaggard.org/">illustrations and reprint editions</a>, while newspapers and <a href="https://archive.org/details/wideworldmagazin2022unse/page/n31/mode/2up">magazine entries</a> can show how Africa was presented to the public.</p>

					<p>While we initially begin by examining the construction of Africa as exploitable racialized geography, we later read elements in the module that can weave together the responses of Africans and South Asians as counterpoints to these colonial genres. Section 3.2 explores Indigenous African responses to both travel narrative genre and the African romance narrative.</p>

					<p>The self-reflexive critique in these texts&mdash;Plaatje&rsquo;s <em>Mhudi,</em> for example&mdash;show not only how deeply embedded the discursive construct of Africa became in a global cultural context, but the variety of ways in which African writers directly and indirectly fractured its hypotheses. Horton&rsquo;s <em>West African Countries and Peoples</em>, for instance, was published before Henry Morton Stanley&rsquo;s major works, and it explicitly charges Europeans with racism in sections titled &ldquo;Exposition of Erroneous Views Respecting the African&rdquo; and &ldquo;False Theories of Modern Anthropologists.&rdquo;</p>

					<p>Section 3.3 presents two famous Bengali adaptations of the imperial romance genre, where traditional elements of exploration, mineral extraction, and interracial encounter are complicated by the emerging politics of decolonization, indentured labor, and the creation of new middle classes in the global south. Reading these texts together produces a &ldquo;widening&rdquo; of our critical and historical lenses (Banerjee, Fong, and Michie) as we investigate empire&rsquo;s impacts in terms of geography <em>and </em>genre.</p>

					<p>Some broad questions that emerge move us beyond the limits of transatlantic racial relations and into an Indian Ocean framework, highlighting South-South relations as central to race-making. How do colonial print imaginaries of Africa circulate in the Indian Ocean world (Hofmeyr)? What forms of transnational and transcultural contact between Asian and African populations do they generate (Lowe)? And finally, what happens when the figure of the white imperialist is transposed upon that of the abjected South Asian laborer (Sengupta)?</p>

					<p>These concerns inform our engagement with Bengali print culture about Africa in the twentieth century (Mowtushi; Banerjee and Basu), where Africa became the site of exploring ideas of primitivity and modernity during the era of active decolonization in the subcontinent (Burton). Examining the impact of old modes of racialization on newer texts shows the resilience of Victorian narrations of race and coloniality in the pre- and post-Independence contact across the Indian Ocean world.</p>

					<p>While primary texts explore the granular processes shaping the creation of an imperialist imagination, the list of secondary readings cut across individual texts, illuminating certain transhistorical trajectories that illustrate the successful and failed mobilities of the British empire (Banerjee). For that reason, it is important not to generalize the lessons of this module, particularly it is hard to cast a single experience as necessarily representative of massive phenomena like indentureship or settler colonialism.</p>

					<p>Resisting that urge, this module encourages students to look for, pay attention to, care about, and recover individual stories and textured experiences of extraction under the aegis of colonialism&rsquo;s narrative genres. Just as images of Africa cannot be used as a generalization of the continent, similarly, the perspectives of individual Bengali writers&mdash;though writing within a milieu&mdash;must be given individual attention instead of being granted value as appropriate representatives of a class of fiction. Read in this way, these texts offer critiques of empire that can be aggregated to develop a wider perspective of the nineteenth century and its legacies over time.</p>

					<p><u>A note about images:</u> I have not provided an extensive list of visual materials especially since the archive of visualizing empire is so vast and easily accessible. Most of the primary texts come with illustrations. The issue is not the paucity of illustrations but the recognition of their disturbing nature and the fact that they emerge out of a complex epistemological tradition of remaking an &ldquo;image-Africa&rdquo; (Landau) for cultural and political gain.</p>

					<h3 id="lesson-ideas">Lesson/Module Ideas</h3>

					<section aria-labelledby="idea-1">
						<h4 id="idea-1">King<em> Solomon&rsquo;s Mines</em> and <em>Chander Pahar</em></h4>
						<p>These two texts pair very successfully, since Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay&rsquo;s novel clearly cites H.R. Haggard&rsquo;s earlier work. The structure of the journey bears many similarities&mdash;a Portuguese man brings news of hidden diamonds, a pact is formed among explorers, they experience many challenges (animal attacks, violent conflicts with Indigenous peoples, entrapment inside caves) and finally rescue the wealth.</p>

						<p>While drawing attention to the exact echoes can lead to a productive discussion of the circulation of imperial genres, another path might be to explore how these apparently similar moments are mobilized to express very different political ends in the two texts. If the texts are used to chart a shifting geography of South-Central Africa, then Melissa Free&rsquo;s lesson plan on <a href="https://undiscipliningvc.org/html/lesson_plans/africa_southern_africa.html">South Africa 1820-1930</a> could be placed very productively in conversation with them.</p>

						<p>One approach would be to pair specific scenes (the arrival of the sick Jos&eacute;/the arrival of the sick Alvarez; the two sequences of being trapped in a cave and finding diamonds). Another point of entry may be to use historical sources/archival documents (see 5.1-2) to contextualize the different moments of empire these texts reference&mdash;the creation of a settler state in South Africa vs. the interwar period, decolonization, and changing politics of labor and immigration.</p>

							<h5 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h5>
							<ol>
								<li>How does the figure of Quatermain have an afterlife in the minds of young English-educated colonial subjects like Shankar? What are the conditions preventing him from/enabling him from becoming like Quatermain?</li>
								<li>How does the relationship between Shankar and Diego Alvarez represent a mutation of the homosocial logics of the bond between Haggard&rsquo;s &ldquo;three white men&rdquo;? In what way does it restage the relationship between the trio and the figure of Umbopa/Ignosi?</li>
								<li>What do the representation of Indigenous Africans in the two texts tell us about what the authors believed/knew/read about Africans? Discuss the different levels of engagement the authors had with the communities they are describing and what effect that might have on characterization?</li>
								<li>Compare the illustrations of the Bengali text with the images in the original Cassell and Co. illustrated edition. What are the technological differences between the two? What do the mis-en-sc&egrave;ne of the respective images and the reproduction processes indicate about the infrastructure of the print networks that produced the two texts?&nbsp;</li>
								<li>Since both have been adapted for film, what can you say about how these narratives have been remediated as modern fantasies of producing racialized geographies?</li>
							</ol>

						<h4 id="idea-2">Mitra, &ldquo;Mosquito&rdquo; and &ldquo;Glass&rdquo; in <em>Mosquito and Other Stories;</em> Lowe, <em>The Intimacies of Four Continents</em><h4>
						<p>The two stories, &ldquo;Mosquito&rdquo; and &ldquo;Glass,&rdquo; offer an excellent glimpse into the neo-imperial re-imagining of Africa in a post-World War II moment. The figure of Ghanada and his exploits in the Sakhalin islands and Angola offer rich interlocutory possibilities with Lisa Lowe&rsquo;s work particularly as they highlight the violent creation of the intercontinental &ldquo;intimacies.&rdquo; Both Ghanada and the anticipated readers of the stories exemplify, to some extent at least, the &ldquo;imperial connections&rdquo; that Lowe draws attention to, in describing the affiliation with Thackeray acknowledged by C. L. R James.</p>

						<p>Not only do the work&rsquo;s readers and characters sketch the survival of an imperial genealogy, Ghanada embodies the dreams and aspirations of the classic figure of a &ldquo;new world modernity&rdquo; (Lowe 80). While the burden of this modern rests on a class of English-educated colonized subjects, it works necessarily by constructing new/newly adapted racial others&mdash;in Ghanada&rsquo;s tales these positions are occupied by the Chinese, Indigenous Africans, and Global South demographic groups.</p>

						<p>Lowe&rsquo;s chapter can provide a long historical backdrop for the two short stories (can be paired with mapping assignment 5.1&mdash;especially since many of the verbal maps were constructed from descriptions in the <em>National Geographic</em>), and the stories themselves can extend and complicate Lowe&rsquo; argument by providing a case study of imagined inter-racial relations by a South Asian writer at the moment of active political decolonization and the formation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Aligned_Movement">Non Aligned Movement.</a> On the other hand, they can be read as parallel histories of rising neo-imperialist sentiment in the postcolonial nation states.</p>

						<h5 id="discussion-questions-2">Discussion Questions</h5>
						<ol>
							<li>Analyze descriptions of Ghanada&rsquo;s physique. How does this description both reaffirm and challenge racialized constructs of Indian/Bengali/South Asian masculinity?</li>
							<li>How would you characterize Ghanada&rsquo;s assessments of white Europeans versus Black Africans? How would you characterize his description of Mr. Nishimara in relation to racial stereotyping?</li>
							<li>How does the text use the language of racialized description to create new political possibilities for South Asians? What kind of South Asians do these possibilities include or exclude?</li>
							<li>What kind of commodities&mdash;clothes, technology, weaponry&mdash;are fetishized in these texts? What kinds of texts/textual constructs (characters, spaces, trajectories) are preferred over others in your opinion?</li>
							<li>Here is a <a href="https://ghanada.wixsite.com/ghanada-gallery">public resource</a> tracking the history of the illustrations from Ghanada. Discuss the visual pattern/choices of individual illustrators as well as what that tells you about Bengali print culture (which is shaped by empire).</li>
							<li>Compare the illustrations of characters in the text to popular racialized imagery from the nineteenth-century. What are some important connections/transformations?</li>
							<li>Premendra Mitra is widely recognized as a writer of speculative fiction. Which elements would you consider speculative and which elements representative of a post-imperial realism?</li>

					<section aria-labelledby="assignment-1">
						<h4 id="assignment-1">Mapping Assignment</h4>
						<p>Since these primary texts contain racialized geographies that are produced from a relationship between imperial print culture and the imagination, one simple mapping assignment might be to compare three maps of African territories:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>An early hand-drawn/published map by a European explorer</li>
								<li>A twentieth-century map of the region</li>
								<li>A fictional map (either verbal or visual)</li>
							</ol>

							<p>Edward Said&rsquo;s concept of &ldquo;imaginary geographies&rdquo; (<em>Orientalism</em>) and Matthew H. Edney&rsquo;s concept of &ldquo;framing&rdquo; colonized space may assist students with articulating the strategic differences of mapping used in each of the three objects.</p>

							<p>Step 1: The assignment can start from the idea that maps are layered, so Map 1 led to the creation of Map 2 and Map 3; in some cases, both Map 1 and Map 2 lead to the creation of Map 3.</p>

							<p>Step 2: Interrogating and historicizing the clearly inaccurate maps will lead to a more critical engagement with the history of mapping itself.</p>

							<p>Step 3: Finally, the class will approach the goal of defamiliarizing the &ldquo;contemporary map&rdquo; as a product of fiction, politics, and power deeply shaped by imperial technologies and fantasies.</p>

							<p>Step 4: This critique of maps of Africa could be articulated visually as slides or a Story Map that demonstrates the political decision-making that impacted the process of marking colonial space.</p>

					<section aria-labelledby="assignment-2">
						<h4 id="assignment-2">Archival Assignment</h4>
						<p>Archival assignments in the classroom serve to familiarize students with the material aspects of these texts. An example of such an assignment that can be completed in class is one pairing <em>Mountains of the Moon</em> with articles from <em>Indian Opinion</em>, the activist pamphlet published by Mahatma Gandhi in South Africa to agitate on because of South Asians&rsquo; political rights. Hofmeyr&rsquo;s chapter situating the physical context of the pamphlet&rsquo;s publication (ch. 3) and Carter and Torabully&rsquo;s discussion of indentured workers becoming &ldquo;international proletarians&rdquo; (ch, 2; 2002) can provide framing material for the exercise.</p>

						<p>Step 1: Select an early volume of Indian opinion, for example <a href="https://ia600704.us.archive.org/5/items/HindSwaraj.IndianOpinion.1.vol5/HindSwaraj.IndianOpinion.1.vol5.pdf">Vol 5</a>.</p>

						<p>Step 2: Students can spend some time in larger groups discussing the structure and framework of the volume. There could be broad guiding questions about print production, typography, images, multilingualism, materiality, etc. to situate their explorations.</p>

						<p>Step 3: Each student should pick 3 items connecting the same rough topic&mdash;it could be 2 advertisements and 1 article about bicycle sales for instance. They could triangulate these three sources, use their own research skills, and craft a brief glimpse of life viewed from the perspective of Indians in South Africa in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
						
						<p>Step 4: They could place this narrative in conversation with any of the primary/secondary text in this module to frame their discovery within a larger context of exploring indentureship, migration, and racialized labor in empire.</p>
