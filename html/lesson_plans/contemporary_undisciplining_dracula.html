					<h3 id="description">Pair Description</h3>
						<section aria-labelledby="context">
							<h4 id="context">Course Context</h4>
							<p>This essay/lesson plan pairs Bram Stoker&rsquo;s 1897 novel <em>Dracula</em> with Octavia Butler&rsquo;s 2005 novel <em>Fledgling</em>, two vampire novels that deal with questions of race, authenticity, and futurity. Familiar to most people on this site, <em>Dracula</em> is a multiply narrated tale about a Transylvanian vampire who comes to England to vamp English women before he&rsquo;s chased back to Eastern Europe and killed by a group of English, American, and Dutch men who don&rsquo;t realize that Dracula&rsquo;s vampiric blood will always linger in their offspring. <em>Fledgling</em>, perhaps less familiar, is narrated by a young Black vampire (or Ina) named Shori, who has been genetically engineered by a small group of white Ina to be stronger and more resistant to sunlight than the white Ina have ever been. The novel begins in the wake of a brutal attack on Shori and her family that has left Shori alone and with amnesia, and follows her as she regains her memory, survives further attacks, rediscovers her Ina community and identity, and confronts her attackers in a brutal trial that reveals the conservatism and deep racism underpinning the way many of the &ldquo;original&rdquo; Ina understand their culture.</p>
							
							<p>I have paired these novels in two different classes: a Vampires in Literature and Popular Culture class and a Gothic Imagination class. Although these classes have different frameworks, both trouble the hierarchical relationship between &ldquo;original&rdquo; and &ldquo;adaptation,&rdquo; as well as examine the metaphors through which gothic texts establish (and/or demolish) ideas about national identity, borders, and normativity.</p>
						</section>

						<section aria-labelledby="originality">
							<h4 id="originality">Origins/Originals</h4>
							<p>This pairing is central to both classes because while Stoker&rsquo;s novel is often considered the &ldquo;original&rdquo; vampire novel (an idea that is historically inaccurate, as well as politically problematic), Butler&rsquo;s novel explicitly rearranges the canon of Western vampire fiction to place her vampires at its origin point. In doing so, she deliberately inverts the aesthetic relationship between <em>Dracula</em> and the contemporary vampire fiction tradition, demonstrating just how culturally constructed the fetishization of aesthetic originality is. Further, by situating its meditations on origins and adaptation specifically in the context of race and Black futurity, <em>Fledgling</em> creates a racialized framework for <em>Dracula</em>&rsquo;s own uncertainties about the value and precarity of originality, one that invites us to consider what is hidden, lost, or afforded when a Victorian text embeds its racial politics in form and metaphor.</p>
						</section>

						<section aria-labelledby="metaphor">
							<h4 id="metaphor">Metaphor and Reading Practice</h4>
							<p>As Victorianists, we don&rsquo;t need <em>Fledgling</em>&rsquo;s anti-Black racism, non-heteronormative sexualities, and disconcerting power structures to understand that <em>Dracula</em> is invested in similar issues of race, sex, and power&mdash;we know this already. Instead, we need <em>Fledgling</em> to show us that there are fundamental political differences between racism and allegories of racism, between sexual violence and metaphors for sexual violence, and between acknowledged hierarchies and implicit power differentials. This pairing aims not only to make <em>Fledgling</em>&rsquo;s Afrofuturism and anti-racism central to reimagining a genre that has historically been mired in white racist ideologies, but also to focus students&rsquo; attention on the politics of reading practice itself: the kinds of reading that texts do and don&rsquo;t enable, the assumptions about identity that shape our readings, and the potential for careless reading to reify the very prejudices we&rsquo;re trying to resist.</p>
						</section>
				</section>

				<section aria-labelledby="frameworks">
					<h3 id="frameworks">Overview of Critical Frameworks</h3>
					<p>There are three primary critical frameworks that are key to this pairing: adaptation theory, <em>Dracula</em> and race, and Afrofuturism. The first introduces the unit, providing a set of terms that troubles the primacy of &ldquo;originality&rdquo; and allows students to recognize strategies through which <em>Dracula</em> and <em>Fledgling</em> play with questions of origins, evolutions, and authenticity. The second both acquaints students with the various racisms that <em>Dracula</em> has been associated with and complicates the methodological practice of defining Count Dracula in terms of specific &ldquo;othered&rdquo; identities. The third prompts students to consider why Butler frames a story of all-too-familiar racist and misogynistic violence in the form of vampire fiction, a genre that so often participates in rather than stands against such ideologies, and what kinds of &ldquo;imagining otherwise&rdquo; are possible when writers create such fantasy worlds with Black voices at their centers. I devote the greatest space to Afrofuturism, as Butler is inextricable from this critical landscape and it is essential to my efforts to undiscipline how I teach vampire fiction. As someone who primarily teaches nineteenth-century British and Irish literature, this is a body of criticism with which I have little experience, and while my work here only scratches the surface of this vast field I offer it as one path to teaching <em>Fledgling</em>&rsquo;s significance beyond the primarily white vampire canon in which my courses place it.</p>
					
					<p>The path I trace through these three frameworks follows my own pedagogical trajectory as I teach these two books in my courses, but it isn&rsquo;t meant to be prescriptive. Each framework/discussion section includes multiple secondary sources, sub-topics, and reading approaches that can be plucked out, recombined, and/or routed through other novels to produce new ideas and create different connections.&nbsp;</p>
				</section>

				<section aria-labelledby="adaptation">
					<h3 id="adaptation">Key Texts: Adaptation Theory</h3>
					<p>As the most adapted literary character of all time (not counting Santa Claus), Count Dracula presents an excellent case study in the generative possibilities of unmooring cultural phenomena from their points of origin. At the same time, both <em>Dracula</em> and <em>Fledgling</em> care deeply about the value and the potential dangers of adaptation: adaptation to other cultures, to other media, and to other evolutionary forms. I therefore pepper this unit with a variety of theories of adaptation:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Walter Benjamin, &ldquo;The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction&rdquo;</li>
							<li>Linda Hutcheon, <em>A Theory of Adaptation</em> (selections)</li>
							<li>Jorgen Bruhn, &ldquo;Dialogizing Adaptation&rdquo;</li>
							<li>Jennifer Wicke, &ldquo;Vampiric Typewriting&rdquo;</li>
							<li>Gary R. Bortolotti&rsquo;s and Linda Hutcheon, &ldquo;On the Origin of Adaptations: Rethinking Fidelity Discourse and &lsquo;Success&rsquo - Biologically*&rdquo;</li>
						</ul>
				</section>

				<section aria-labelledby="dracula-and-race">
					<h3 id="dracula-and-race">Key Texts: <em>Dracula</em> and Race </h3>
					<p>These three pieces provide a progression from understanding <em>Dracula</em> as a racist novel to understanding the ways it mounts critiques of racist ideologies. In working through these critical analyses, I aim to guide students away from antagonistic, essentialist reading practices in which Stoker&rsquo;s novel is littler more than snapshot of 19<sup>th</sup>-century xenophobia and towards a more complex imagining of <em>Dracula</em>&rsquo;s anti-racist potential.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Stephen D. Arata, &ldquo;The Occidental Tourist: <em>Dracula</em> and the Anxiety of Reverse Colonization&rdquo;</li>
							<li>Jack Halberstam, &ldquo;Technologies of Monstrosity: Bram Stoker&rsquo;s <em>Dracula</em>&rdquo; (Chapter 4 of <em>Skin Shows</em>)</li>
							<li>Joseph Valente, <em>Dracula&rsquo;s Crypt: Bram Stoker, Irishness, and the Question of Blood</em> (selections)</li>
						</ul>
				</section>

				<section aria-labelledby="afrofuturism">
					<h3 id="afrofuturism">Key Texts: Afrofuturism </h3>
					<p>These texts work together to help answer a question I often pose at the beginning of our <em>Fledgling</em> discussions: if this novel is straightforwardly about racism and the stupidity and violence racism leads to, why does it need to be a vampire novel? These readings answer this question by addressing the history of Black vampires, the importance of Blackness as a vampiric survival tool in the novel, and the significance of Black characters in speculative fiction more largely.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Jerry Rafiki Jenkins, <em>The Paradox of Blackness in African American Vampire Fiction</em> (selections)</li>
							<li>Mark Dery, &ldquo;Black to the Future&rdquo;</li>
							<li>Susana M. Morris, &ldquo;Black Girls are from the Future: Afrofuturist Feminism in <em>Fledgling</em>&rdquo;</li>
							<li>Octavia Butler, &ldquo;We Tend to Do the Right Thing When We Get Scared&rdquo; (<em>NY Times</em>  interview)</li>
							<li>Octavia Butler, &ldquo;Positive Obsession&rdquo;</li>
						</ul>
				</section>

				<section aria-labelledby="discussions">
					<h3 id="discussion">Discussions</h3>

					<section aria-labelledby="adaptation-discussion-1">
						<h4 id="adaptation-discussion-1"><em>Dracula</em> and Adaptation</h4>
						<p>Our discussion of <em>Dracula</em> and adaptation has three primary aims, besides priming students to be attentive to the ways in which <em>Fledgling</em> deliberately problematizes the idea of original vampires. First, it acknowledges and makes meaningful the wide and ongoing dissemination of Draculas across time, media, and culture, creating space for students to bring their popular, non-textual experiences with <em>Dracula</em> into the classroom. Second, it helps students release their inclination to privilege an original text over its multiple cultural propagations: since we&rsquo;ll be spending significant time close reading Stoker&rsquo;s novel itself, it&rsquo;s important that students understand early on that our close attention to the text of the novel doesn&rsquo;t mean that the ways in which this text has been adapted aren&rsquo;t equally worthy of scholarly attention. And third, it contextualizes the myriad adaptations of <em>Dracula </em>within and against the late 19<sup>th</sup>-century rise of new media technologies, providing a theoretical/historical framework for the novel&rsquo;s own investments in mechanisms of adaptation and situating adaptations <em>of</em> the novel in relation to issues of adaptation <em>in</em> the novel.</p>

						<section aria-labelledby="stamps">
							<h5 id="stamps">Postage Stamps</h5>
							<p>One useful tool for opening a conversation about Dracula and adaptation is the <a href="https://www.horror.org/private/newsletter/october-2015/183-noboundaries.html#:~:text=Ireland%20celebrated%20the%20centenary%20of,the%20centenary%20of%20Stoker's%20death.">2012 commemorative postage stamps</a> Ireland issued to celebrate the centenary of Bram Stoker&rsquo;s death, which feature a classic image from the 1930 Tod Browning <em>Dracula </em>movie and arrive in a decorative envelope featuring Count Dracula trying to get into a cinema whose marquee reads &ldquo;Author of Dracula: Bram Stoker, 1847-1912.&rdquo;</p>
							
							<p>These stamps commemorating the author of a novel aren&rsquo;t at all interested in the novel itself. Instead, they disperse the novel into its myriad cinematic adaptations and give Count Dracula an embodied life of his own, one quite excited about seeing itself reflected on the big screen. Rather than honoring an author&rsquo;s original 19<sup>th</sup>-century text, these stamps unmoor <em>Dracula</em> from the authorial imagination that created it, celebrating the cultural proliferation of <em>Dracula</em> and Dracula across mediums and national traditions.</p>
						</section>

						<section aria-labelledby="theorizing-adaptation">
							<h5 id="theorizing-adaptation">Theorizing/Dialogizing Adaptation</h5>
							<p>Both Hutcheon and Bruhn provide models for thinking about the ongoing life of <em>Dracula </em>beyond its textual walls. Hutcheon argues that, like a translation, an adaptation is always &ldquo;an engagement with the original text that makes us see that text in different ways&rdquo; and &ldquo;an act of both inter-cultural and inter-temporal communication&rdquo; (16), while Bruhn argues that &ldquo;original&rdquo; and &ldquo;adaptation&rdquo; are &ldquo;infinitely changing positions, taking turns being sources for each other in the ongoing work of the reception in the adaptational process&rdquo; (73). In both cases, the &ldquo;work of art&rdquo; ceases to exist in singular, Benjaminian terms, instead constantly forming and reforming through adaptation&rsquo;s dynamic process of communication.</p>
						</section>

						<section aria-labelledby="mechanical-reproduction">
							<h5 id="mechanical-reproduction">Mechanical Reproduction</h5>
							<p>Thinking of <em>Dracula</em> as a mobile cultural phenomenon rather than as a static works of art provides a useful entry point into &ldquo;The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,&rdquo; as students are primed to see artistic proliferation in positive rather than negative terms. Moving from adaptation studies more generally to Benjamin specifically enables us to move from thinking about <em>Dracula</em> as a palimpsest of adaptations to considering how the vampire figure itself attends to questions of authenticity, tradition, and reproducibility. Most students have enough cultural exposure to vampires to be able to consider vampiric reproduction in relation to the way Benjamin describes the reproduction of a work of art: &ldquo;the technique of reproduction detaches the reproduced object from the domain of tradition. By making many reproductions it substitutes a plurality of copies for a unique existence&rdquo; (220).</p>
						</section>

						<section aria-labelledby="vampiric-reproduction">
							<h5 id="vampiric-reproduction">Vampiric Reproduction</h5>
							<p>Benjamin lays a contextual foundation for students to consider <em>Dracula</em> as a product/reflection of the same &ldquo;age of technological reproducibility&rdquo; that Benjamin&rsquo;s essay focuses on. By talking about photography, film, typewriting, shorthand, and other such technologies that emerged in the latter decades of the nineteenth century, and that catalyzed both the narrative form of <em>Dracula</em> *and* Benjamin&rsquo;s reflections on art&rsquo;s movement out of the elitist realm of privilege and into the domain of the masses, we can discuss why it&rsquo;s not a coincidence that vampiric reproduction and Benjaminian reproduction seem to be so easy to discuss in the same breath. In my classes, these conversations usually take place before students have gotten very far into <em>Dracula</em> (sometimes before they have begun reading), so I use the novel&rsquo;s brief preface to launch a discussion about the novel&rsquo;s investments in authenticity, objectivity, reproduction, and mediation.</p>
						</section>

						<section aria-labelledby="typewriting">
							<h5 id="typewriting">A Mass of Typewriting</h5>
							<p>As we get further into the novel we read Wicke&rsquo;s &ldquo;Vampiric Typewriting,&rdquo; revisiting these opening conversations about originality and authenticity by addressing the more specific relationship between vampirism and technological reproduction that Wicke&rsquo;s essay articulates. The epilogue to the novel admits that &ldquo;hardly one authentic document remains; nothing but a mass of typewriting,&rdquo; and so I both begin and end our <em>Dracula </em>unit by considering the text&rsquo;s reflections on the impossibility of authenticity. I do this not only because the text itself begins and ends this way but also because I want us to move into our discussion of <em>Fledgling</em> thinking about <em>Dracula</em> not as a stodgy 19th-century point of origin to be dismissed, but as enabling vampire fiction&rsquo;s challenges to faith in the &ldquo;real,&rdquo; its unsettling of linear history (literary or otherwise), and its openness to alternative and marginal voices.</p>
