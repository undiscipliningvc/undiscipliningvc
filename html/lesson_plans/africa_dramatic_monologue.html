					<h3 id="goals">Goals, Questions, and Usage</h3>

					<p>Although the monologue is a literary device that surfaces in several literary and historical periods, it went through some especially convoluted developments in the nineteenth century. For example, the tension between character and audience that is inherent to the monologue’s form intensified when Victorian poets imbued the device with irony and played with the presumed distance between the identity of the poet and the monologue’s speaker. Critics have noted how developments like these added rhetorical and psychological complexity to the literary device, thus transforming it into the <em>dramatic</em> monologue. But these aesthetic developments were also intertwined with political concerns related to race and imperialism.</p>

					<p>This lesson plan prompts a direct engagement with those concerns by attending to the political implications of the dramatic monologue as it shifts in context and authorship. What happens to the dramatic monologue when it moves from seemingly apolitical topics such as romantic love to overtly political ones such as abolition and enslavement? What are the advantages and limitations of the device when white poets use it to imagine a Black character or the experience of enslavement? How do Black poets during and after the Victorian period challenge their white counterparts by reinventing the device altogether? And how do the racial tensions exhibited in these poems from the long nineteenth century continue to reverberate outward to the present day?</p>

					<h3 id="materials">Organization and Suggested Materials</h3>

					<p>This lesson plan is designed with flexibility in mind so that instructors can adapt and adopt it to meet their departmental/institutional requirements and their own pedagogical goals. The primary and secondary materials have been laid out in five sections to mimic a hypothetical five-week unit, along with sample discussion questions that act as starting points for each class. Instructors can adapt this lesson plan for a unit in a semester-long introductory course for undergraduates about Victorian literature, Victorian poetry, or poetry more broadly, or they can scale the lesson plan up for an advanced course about these topics. Each week in this lesson plan could also stand on its own, meaning that instructors could simply use certain segments as needed. Feedback or suggestions about any part of this lesson plan are welcome.</p>

						<h4 id="materials-1">Heavy Is The Head That Wears The Crown (Week One)</h4>

						<p>This unit introduces students to the dramatic monologue by juxtaposing Robert Browning with the Harlem Renaissance poet, Anne Spencer, who both was inspired by and reimagined Browning’s approach to the form. Students can explore how the form’s ironic distance between poet and speaker allows Browning and Spencer to critique imperial figures. Additionally, they can examine what these critiques reveal about imperial ideologies. Instructors can also use the selected monologues to introduce core poetic concepts such as meter and rhyme.</p>

						<section aria-labelledby="questions-1">
							<h5 id="questions-1">Sample Discussion Questions</h5>
							
							<ul>
								<li>What kinds of speakers do Browning and Spencer craft? What relationship do these speakers have to power? What do they want, value, and need, and how do they behave? How does their need to control women’s bodies, for example, mirror the way that empires (in this case, a British and a Persian one, respectively) interact with their colonies? (McClintock’s chapter would be helpful background reading for this last question.)</li>

								<li>What are the similarities between the two monologues? Why do these similarities matter?</li>

								<li>What are the differences between Browning’s and Spencer’s monologues? Why does it matter, for example, that the words of characters like Vashti are legible to the reader, while the Duchess’s are not? What do critics like Karapetkova conclude about the differences between Browning and Spencer?</li>

								<li>Do you think the monologue’s ironic “I” allows Browning and Spencer to create an effective moral distance from their speakers? Do you think Spencer’s monologue is more or less subversive than Browning’s? Why?</li>
