					<h3 id="description">Cluster/Pair Description</h3>
					<p>Over the last decade, digital technologies have provided instructors in Victorian studies with a rich and remarkably global pool of nineteenth-century archival materials for classroom teaching. Yet the rapid recovery of these materials has also raised questions about how our students might navigate the imperialist, racist, sexist, and homophobic strains that invariably shape them. Scholars such as Saidiya Hartman, for instance, have highlighted how captive and oppressed peoples in the nineteenth-century are only knowable to us today through the very archival documents that reinforced their bondage, such as slave &ldquo;property&rdquo; ledgers or derogatory diary descriptions that slave owners wrote.</p>

					<p>This lesson plan invites students to explore how two contemporary books&mdash;Saidiya Hartman&rsquo;s <em>Wayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments: Intimate Histories of Riotous Black Girls, Troublesome Women, and Queer Radicals</em> and Nalo Hopkinson&rsquo;s <em>The Salt Roads&mdash;</em>work within and against these archival documents in order to offer another picture of captive and oppressed lives and experiences in the nineteenth-century. The learning goal is to explore how both writers re-cast the erasures or dehumanizing representations of captive and oppressed peoples in nineteenth-century archival materials, ranging from figures such as Gladys Bentley, Jeanne Duval, W.E.B. Du Bois, and Ida D. Wells, to &ldquo;minor&rdquo; or unnamed individuals.</p>

					<p>In the process, this plan invites students to explore the narrative techniques that Hartman and Hopkinson use (such as critical fabulation and speculative fiction), and to consider the role that genre, queerness, and the writer&rsquo;s positionality play in Hartman and Hopkinson&rsquo;s books. It also encourages students to engage with Black studies, Caribbean studies, and African-American studies. Instructors in these fields, and transatlantic nineteenth century studies, American studies, or narrative theory may also find this plan helpful. The plan at present is flexible, leaving room for instructors to adapt it for their own needs and stressing areas that could be scaled up into a full course or scaled down into units within a larger course. Suggested assignments include the standard academic essay, a reflective essay, and, by way of Katherine McKittrick, a &ldquo;demonic&rdquo; mapping project.</p>

					<h3 id="summaries">Summaries and Critical Frameworks</h3>
					<section aria-labelledby="materials-1">
						<h4 id="materials-1">Summaries</h4>
						<section aria-labelledby="Hartman">
							<h5 id="Hartman">Hartman, Saidiya. <em>Wayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments Intimate Histories of Riotous Black Girls, Troublesome Women, and Queer Radicals</em>. W. W. Norton & Company, 2019.</h5>
			
							<p>Hartman's book depicts the lives and experiences of Black and queer individuals in the United States in the late nineteenth- and twentieth-centuries, within and against the archival documents that record their presence. It re-reads historical materials like photographs, ledgers, and police reports to show how iconic Black figures W.E.B. Du Bois, Ida D. Wells, and Gladys Bentley, as well as scores of ordinary, everyday Black figures invented new ways of living, loving, and surviving in a nation that was predisposed to treating them with suspicion and hostility after the abolishment of slavery.</p>
						</section>
						<section aria-labelledby="Hopkinson">
							<h5 id="Hopkinson">Hopkinson, Nalo. <em>The Salt Roads</em>. Warner Books, 2003.</h5>
			
							<p>Hopkinso's book draws from historical documents in order to reimagine the lives and experiences of three women in the Black diaspora - Mer, an eighteenth-century slave in St. Domingue, Jeanne Duval, a Haitian actress and mistress of French Decadent poet Charles Baudelaire, and Thais, a fourth century prostitute-turned-saint in Alexandria, Egypt. It bends the restrictions of time and space, moving from one figure to another non-linearly through the perspective of a goddess, Lasir&eacute;n (a water spirit who plays a role in several myths and spiritual systems of the African diaspora).</p>
						</section>
					</section>
					<section aria-labelledby="materials-2">
						<h4 id="materials-2">Frameworks</h4>
						<p>These frameworks should be used to support the discussions suggested and the assignments in subsequent sections.</p>
						<section aria-labelledby="Venus">
							<h5 id="Venus">Hartman, Saidiya. &ldquo;Venus in Two Acts.&rdquo; <em>Small Axe</em>, vol. 12, no. 2, 2008, pp. 1-14, and &ldquo;A Note On Method.&rdquo; <em>Wayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments: Intimate Histories of Riotous Black Girls, Troublesome Women, and Queer Radicals</em>. W.W. Norton & Company, 2019. xiii-xv.</h5>
			
							<p>In these pieces, Hartman outlines how critical fabulation aims to &ldquo;liberate [captive and oppressed peoples] from the obscene descriptions [in archival documents] that first introduced them to us&rdquo; (&ldquo;Venus,&rdquo; 6), to generate a &ldquo;different set of descriptions from this archive . . . [and] imagine what could have been&rdquo; (7). Expanding on this narrative strategy in <em>Wayward, </em>she explains that her technique of &ldquo;close narration,&rdquo; attempts to place &ldquo;the voice of the narrator and character in inseparable relation so that the vision, language, and rhythms of the wayward shape and arrange [her] text&rdquo; (&ldquo;A Note,&rdquo; xiii-xiv).</p>
						</section>
						<section aria-labelledby="Rutledge">
							<h5 id="Rutledge">Rutledge, Gregory E., and Nalo Hopkinson. &ldquo;Speaking in Tongues: An Interview with Science Fiction Writer Nalo Hopkinson.&rdquo; <em>African American Review</em>, vol. 33, no. 4, 1999, pp. 589-601.</h5>
			
							<p>In this wide-ranging interview, Hopkinson outlines what, for her, constitutes speculative fiction (and the interrelated genres of science fiction and fantasy). For Hopkinson, speculative fiction is not just wishful thinking but a genre that allows &ldquo;black people [to] reimagine [their] futures . . . [so that] we can then begin to see our way clear to creating them&rdquo; (593). She also explores the relationship between speculative fiction and realism in ways that implicitly place pressure on the mid-Victorian realist novel. As she puts it, &ldquo;a guy in a realist fiction isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;guy&rdquo; . . . It&rsquo;s a fabulation onto which the author has crafted the illusion that you&rsquo;re perceiving a human&rdquo; (597).</p>
						</section>
						<section aria-labelledby="Lorde">
							<h5 id="Lorde">Lorde, Audre. &ldquo;Uses of the Erotic: The Erotic as Power.&rdquo; <em>Sister Outsider: Essays and Speeches</em>, Ten Speed Press, 2007, pp. 53-59.</h5>
			
							<p>Lorde explains that western society has “vilified, abused, and devalued” (53) eroticism, and argues that we must recuperate it. Lorde urges us to see eroticism as a “life-force” (55) that exists beyond the confines of the bedroom: it is the “sharing of joy, whether physical, emotional, psychic, or intellectual, [which] forms a bridge between the sharers . . . and lessens the threat of difference” (56). It is also a revolutionary affect that involves the  empower us to “demand from ourselves and from our life-pursuits that they feel in accordance with that joy which we know ourselves to be capable of” (57).</p>
						</section>
						<section aria-labelledby="Spillers">
							<h5 id="Spillers">Spillers, Hortense J. &ldquo;Mama&rsquo;s Baby, Papa&rsquo;s Maybe: An American Grammar Book.&rdquo; <em>Diacritics</em>, vol. 17, no. 2, 1987, pp. 65-81.</h5>
			
							<p>This is a necessary text, but it is also more densely articulated than the texts above, so it will be up to the instructor to decide how to navigate it based on the level of the course that they are teaching. Here, Spillers outlines how enslavement produced conditions (eg. rape, the removal of mother from child, the displacement of the Black father by the white slave master), that complicated the normative gendering&mdash;what Spillers coins as an &ldquo;un-gendering&rdquo;&mdash;of Black men and women, and disrupted how familial bonds in Black families were subsequently forged. Perhaps what is most important to this lesson plan is Spiller&rsquo;s suggestion that Black women have the potential create a different social subject outside of &ldquo;the traditional symbolics of female gender . . . [and in the process] rewrite after all a radically different text for female empowerment&rdquo; (80).</p>
						</section>
					<p>Instructors should note that the historical documents that Hartman and Hopkinson rely on are themselves included in the books, so students can engage directly with them as they read. A scaled-up version of this lesson plan might supplement Hartman and Hopkinson&rsquo;s books with some digital archival materials about the era, and draw on some of the starting points listed in Sophia Hsu&rsquo;s lesson plan, "<a href="https://undiscipliningvc.org/html/lesson_plans/africa_archival_erasure.html">Archival Erasure and the Aftermath of Slavery</a>."</p>
